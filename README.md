## Overview 
 
Understanding the sentiment conveyed in Federal Reserve (Fed) speeches is crucial for anticipating market 
reactions and economic expectations. This study employs Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to 
analyze the sentiment of Fed speeches, leveraging FinBERT, a transformer-based model fine-tuned for financial text analysis. 
We retrieve historical Fed transcripts, pre-process the text, and apply FinBERT to extract sentiment scores. 
To enhance our analysis, we employ various statistical methods to examine sentiment trends, correlations with economic 
indicators, and potential predictive signals for monetary policy shifts. 
The results provide insights into how the Fed’s tone fluctuates over time and its relationship with market conditions. This paper outlines our methodology,
implementation details, and key findings, offering a data-driven approach to sentiment analysis in
central bank communications.
