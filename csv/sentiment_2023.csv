Bowman,2023-12-05 10:00:00-05:00,"I would like to thank the Aspen Institute for inviting me to join you at this event to discuss efforts to develop a more inclusive financial system.1 It is really a pleasure to join so many stakeholders that are at the forefront of this important work. As I have often said, one of our important responsibilities is to foster an economy that works for everyone.2 Consumers are better positioned to benefit from economic growth when they have access to financial products and services that responsibly meet their needs.My perspective on financial inclusion is informed, in no small part, from my own experience as a banker. Small banks, especially community banks, have a deep understanding of the local economies they serve, and can respond quickly and effectively to local needs. Indeed, financial inclusion is a core mission of community",0.27584252,0.010430074,0.7137274,neutral,0.26541245,positive,0.7103185057640076

Today, I will discuss my views on why financial inclusion is important to all of usafrom community banks to central banks. I will then highlight activities in which the Federal Reserve participates to promote financial inclusion and conclude with ideas for future work and collaboration.Why Financial Inclusion Is Important An inclusive financial system offers access and choices that enhance consumers' and businesses' financial well-being. From checking and savings accounts to credit and insurance, consumers benefit from having financial products and services that are affordable, safe, and responsive to their needs. Without them, consumers may turn to alternative financial services, which can often be more costly or may lead to consumer harm.An inclusive financial system recognizes that consumers",0.2001073,0.012949497,0.7869432,neutral,0.18715781,neutral,0.8328166604042053

Bowman,2023-12-05 10:02:00-05:00,"come from a wide range of economic circumstances; have varied perceptions of and experiences with the banking system; and most importantly, different needs for financial products and services. And despite the general availability of online financial services, geography, location, and accessibility matter. Financial inclusion may look very different, for instance, in rural communities, compared to the suburbs of Washington, D.C., or the islands of Hawaii. The entire economy gains when more households achieve financial stability. That said, the benefits of financial inclusion do not necessarily result in the same outcomes for everyone.Federal Reserve Activities and Promising Developments The road to fostering a more inclusive financial system is long and winding and may, at times, seem daunting. We have been on this road for some time, and the Federal Reserve and many others have already taken many promising steps.",0.12451431,0.025206255,0.85027945,neutral,0.09930806,neutral,0.8866045475006104
2023-12-05,Governor Michelle W. Bowman,2023-12-05 10:03:00-05:00,"So, I'd like to share a few examples of the Fed's recent efforts to promote financial inclusion that will help to provide some context to our ongoing efforts.Supporting access to responsive products: small-dollar lending For many years, a variety of surveys have indicated that consumers use small-dollar credit to address temporary cash-flow imbalances, unexpected expenses, or income shortfalls during periods of economic stress or natural disasters. So, we began to consider the ways in which the Federal Reserve and other financial regulators could be helpful. Shortly after I joined the Federal Reserve, in 2019 and through 2020, we issued two interagency statements meant to provide clarity to banks on the use of alternative data for underwriting and on principles for offering responsible small-dollar loans.3 Our guidance clarified that with a consumer's permission, banks can use alternative data, like",0.1003957,0.016102962,0.8835013,neutral,0.08429274,neutral,0.7886018753051758
2023-12-05,Governor Michelle W. Bowman,2023-12-05 10:04:00-05:00,"checking account balance activity, to qualify them for credit. Our guidance also underscored that small-dollar lending products that support successful repayment outcomes and that avoid continuous cycles of debt due to rollover and reborrowing can help facilitate financial inclusion. We have seen some evidence that suggests the release of these small-dollar Interagency Lending Principles correlated with a subsequent increase in bank consumer lending.4 Ensuring that small-dollar lending is available through depository institutions rather than through other non-depository lenders could increase the credit opportunities available to consumers at lower cost and with fewer fees.Banks may also pursue expanding their lending opportunities through technology innovations that provide mechanisms for more effective risk modelling or enhancing their online access to financial services for consumers. These advancements can result in faster loan decisionmaking, more convenient customer access, and reduced costs and risks",0.9265219,0.009384729,0.06409338,positive,0.91713715,positive,0.7892898321151733

Over time, we are seeing more banks incorporating these approaches to better serve clients with credit, including the use of alternative data to support underwriting. We will continue to monitor these promising developments to better understand the impact on consumers.Supporting mission-driven organizations I will turn now to the Fed's efforts to build the institutional capacity of a set of key stakeholders: Minority Depository Institutions (MDIs), Women-Owned Depository Institutions (WDIs), and Community Development Financial Institutions (CDFIs), whose missions are to reach historically underserved populations. Providing support for these institutions is an important part of the Federal Reserve's mission to provide a safe, sound, and accessible banking system that protects consumers.5Through the Fed's Partnership for Progress (PFP) program, we provide technical assistance on regulatory matters, conduct research, host convenings, and provide examiner training to support",0.34213758,0.009201858,0.64866054,neutral,0.33293572,positive,0.5633976459503174

Bowman,2023-12-05 10:06:00-05:00,"and promote the stability of MDIs and WDIs.6 Research suggests that MDIs are more likely to focus their products and services to benefit diverse communities and to work with more consumers who experience credit constraints in comparison with non-MDIs.7 The extent of their reach was evident during the 2008 financial crisis and the COVID-19 pandemic, when they demonstrated effective contributions to the economic resiliency of their communities.8 During the pandemic, MDIs and CDFIs provided Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) loans to small businesses and financially underserved firms.9 The Fed supported these important financial service providers by providing liquidity through its emergency lending program, the Paycheck Protection Program Liquidity Facility.10The Emergency Capital Investment Program (ECIP) provided additional support to MDIs and CDFIs. Through the ECIP, MDIs and CDFIs received over $8.5 billion in low-cost capital to support the provision of",0.86774546,0.009234402,0.12302019,positive,0.85851103,positive,0.8731620907783508
2023-12-05,Governor Michelle W. Bowman,2023-12-05 10:07:00-05:00,"loans and grants to small businesses and consumers in their communities. The Federal Reserve conducted collective webinars and individualized outreach to MDIs to encourage enrollment in the program. Our early internal analysis shows, on average, that eligible banks are using ECIP to strengthen balance sheets, build internal capacity, and enhance product offerings. As a result, we have seen ECIP recipients increase their lending about a year after receiving funds, relative to MDIs and CDFIs that did not receive ECIP funding.Supporting Central Bank Network for Indigenous Inclusion This brings me to another aspect of the Federal Reserve's efforts to support financial inclusion. The Fed recently became a member of the Central Bank Network for Indigenous Inclusion (CBNII). This group brings together the central banks of the United States, Canada, New Zealand, and Australia with the purpose of understanding and",0.21252027,0.01100308,0.7764766,neutral,0.2015172,positive,0.9385336637496948

The Fed's CBNII work is supported by many of our Reserve Bank teams, including the San Francisco Reserve Bank, the Minneapolis Center for Indian Country Development (CICD), and the St. Louis Native Economic and Financial Education Empowerment (NEFEE) program.

Two of our most important contributions to the study of financial well-being and consumer wealth are the annual Survey of Household Economics and Decisionmaking (SHED) and the triennial Survey of Consumer Finances (SCF).13 Responses to these surveys are publicly available and are extensively cited by other practitioners and researchers.Researchers and practitioners also rely upon the St. Louis Reserve Bank's Bank On National Data (BOND) Hub, which was created in partnership with Cities for Financial Empowerment's Bank On program.14 Through voluntary and aggregated data reporting, this resource enables the public to track the growth and usage of Bank On accounts in communities across the country.

Before I close, I would like to raise several issues on my mind that might prompt discussion in your event today.First, building on some progress in small-dollar credit, how can we encourage the development of lower-cost products and refine our understanding of the degree to which these products may foster consumers' financial well-being? Second, given the value of mission-driven organizations in expanding access to financial products and services in underserved communities, how can we best provide support to the activities of MDIs, WDIs, and CDFIs?Third, the CBNII relies on the participation and wisdom of Indigenous leaders and community members to advance financial inclusion.

Advancing financial inclusion will clearly take many hands and a diverse set of stakeholders, including everyone participating here today.Closing In closing, greater inclusiveness in the financial system is an ongoing priority for the Federal Reserve, and we will continue to engage on these important issues in the years to come. Progress requires collaboration, and I look forward to engaging with all of you as we continue on the journey to make our financial system more inclusive.1.

For example, I am sure that students are wondering what kind of a job market and economy you will be entering when you complete your education.Congress assigned the Fed the dual mandate goals of maximum employment and price stability. Both goals are essential aspects of a healthy economy. Congress also gave the Fed a precious grant of independence from direct political control to allow us to pursue those goals without consideration of political matters. Other major central banks in democratic societies have similar grants of independence, and this institutional arrangement has a strong track record of producing better policy outcomes for the benefit of",0.15082148,0.018981434,0.8301971,neutral,0.13184005,neutral,0.9114128947257996

Powell,2023-12-01 10:02:00-05:00,"the public.To begin with our maximum employment goal, I am glad to say that, by many measures, conditions in the labor market are very strong. A couple of years ago, as the pandemic receded and the economy reopened, the number of job openings grew to greatly exceed the supply of people available to work, leaving a widespread shortage of workers. Today, labor market conditions remain very strong, and the economy is returning to a better balance between the demand for and supply of workers. The pace at which the economy is creating new jobs remains strong, and has been slowing toward a more sustainable level. That gradual slowing has come in part due to the efforts of the Fed to slow the growth of the economy to help reduce inflation.

Partly because of that labor force growth, the unemployment rate has edged up over the second half of the year, though it remains historically low at 3.9 percent. The increase in participation has been particularly strong among women in the prime working ages of 25 to 54, which surged to an all-time high earlier this year, and which remains well above pre-pandemic levels. Wage growth remains high but has been gradually moving toward levels that would be more consistent with 2 percent price inflation over time, and real wages are growing again as inflation declines.As for price stability, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) has a longer-run goal of 2 percent inflation.2 After running below 2 percent for over a decade, inflation increased sharply in 2021, in the",0.77391744,0.15737928,0.06870323,positive,0.61653817,positive,0.7077312469482422

High inflation imposes a significant hardship on all households and is especially painful for those least able to meet the higher costs of essentials like food, housing, and transportation. Beginning in early 2022, we reacted forcefully, raising our policy interest rate and decreasing the size of our balance sheet to help slow the economy and bring down inflation. Inflation has declined to 3 percent over the 12 months ending in October, but after factoring out energy and food prices, which tend to be volatile, what we call ""core"" inflation is still 3.5 percent, well above our 2 percent objective.Over the six months ending in October, core inflation ran at an annual rate of 2.5 percent, and while the lower inflation readings of the past few months are welcome, that progress must continue if we",0.03595279,0.92265,0.04139721,negative,-0.8866972,negative,0.9578605890274048

High inflation initially emerged from a collision between very strong demand and pandemic-constrained supply. The normalization of supply and demand conditions has played a critical role in the disinflation so far, as has the substantial tightening of monetary policy and overall financial conditions over the past two years.3 The strong actions we have taken have moved our policy rate well into restrictive territory, meaning that tight monetary policy is putting downward pressure on economic activity and inflation. Monetary policy is thought to affect economic conditions with a lag, and the full effects of our tightening have likely not yet been felt. The forcefulness of our response to inflation also helped maintain the Fed's hard-won credibility, ensuring that the public's expectations of future inflation remain well-anchored.

Like most forecasters, my colleagues and I anticipate that growth in spending and output will slow over the next year, as the effects of the pandemic and the reopening fade and as restrictive monetary policy weighs on aggregate demand.5 The FOMC is strongly committed to bringing inflation down to 2 percent over time, and to keeping policy restrictive until we are confident that inflation is on a path to that objective.

In my remarks, I would like to provide perspective on some of the lessons learned from the banking stress experienced in the United States last spring for both banks and their supervisors. In particular, I will focus on how banks manage liquidity risk, the role of the central bank's discount window lending in this process, and the importance of robust liquidity planning for good times and bad.Last March, several large U.S. banks faced acute liquidity pressures when uninsured depositors looked at the banks' balance sheets and judged that the banks would",0.29390493,0.014843958,0.6912511,neutral,0.27906096,neutral,0.7211668491363525

The banks' poor interest rate and liquidity risk management triggered a crisis of confidence in their uninsured depositors, resulting in liquidity crises at these banks. In short, they faced old-fashioned bank runs, the speed of which was anything but old fashioned. Despite their compliance with our capital rules, these banks lacked enough capital to reassure uninsured depositors that they had sufficient resources to weather this liquidity storm.In addition to our domestic strains, Credit Suisse came under renewed pressure in March 2023 after a long period of liquidity pressures that had been acute since the fall of 2022. Of course, Credit Suisse had been a troubled bank for some time, with doubts about its future viability after the Archegos and",0.014869935,0.9610769,0.024053179,negative,-0.946207,negative,0.9534404277801514

While ultimately the amount of their outflows made it not possible for these banks to continue operating, these banks started from a state in which they were not sufficiently equipped to manage liquidity riskaincluding by being",0.037643068,0.85441494,0.10794206,negative,-0.81677186,neutral,0.848953127861023

Banks that experienced spillovers during this period also struggled with insufficiently robust liquidity risk management. It is crucial that banks have a diversified range of liquidity options that they are able to access in a variety of conditions. And in the case of banks that are eligible to borrow from the Federal Reserve, discount window borrowing should be an important part of this mix.There are a few major reasons for this conclusion. First, the discount window provides funding at a predictable interest rate, namely the primary credit rate, which does not fluctuate daily, unlike interest rates on private sector liquidity sources. More specifically, the discount window is always available as a standing facility, with the primary credit rate currently set at the top of",0.051847797,0.038715463,0.9094367,neutral,0.013132334,neutral,0.841317892074585

This rateaalong with that of the standing repo facility (SRF), also set at this levelashould serve as a backstop rate to short-term market interest rates and provide eligible firms with certainty about the highest rate they will face to gain liquidity against eligible assets at any given time. The discount window provides ready access to funding that can help banks manage their liquidity risks. The ability to access funding at a predictable rate through the discount window should figure importantly into banks' liquidity risk management plans under a range of scenarios.The discount window is also an important tool for monetary policy. The primary credit rate, set at the top of the target range, is a component for how we can achieve rate control under a range of",0.12568974,0.011873534,0.8624367,neutral,0.11381621,neutral,0.7865752577781677

Banks have previously said that they are afraid of receiving negative feedback from their supervisors in the event that their sole grounds for tapping the discount window is that it is the most convenient or cheapest form of funding immediately available to them. In light of this, we at the Federal Reserve have been underlining the point to banks, supervisors, analysts, rating agencies, other market observers, and the public, through numerous channels, that using the discount window is not an action to be viewed",0.06413527,0.13791898,0.79794574,neutral,-0.07378371,neutral,0.49923965334892273

Banks need to be ready and willing to use the discount window in good times and bad.The discount window is also an important tool of financial stability, because the Federal Reserve can provide liquidity in an array of circumstances, including those when other sources are impaired. Liquidity provision through the discount window is not reliant on the smooth functioning of private-sector funding markets. This is in contrast to most other options available to banks, including access to the Federal Home Loan Banks (FHLBs). Moreover, banks that have pre-pledged collateral at the discount window and tested its operations are not dependent on other market infrastructure and payments systems to borrow against this collateral.3 These features mean that discount window preparedness provides additional diversification benefits that can meaningfully enhance effective liquidity risk management.The experience",0.31885153,0.010108366,0.6710401,neutral,0.30874318,neutral,0.8504743576049805

In doing so, I will discuss some observations from March in greater depth and note some potential lessons to be drawn from that experience. I will also briefly note some observations about our work on cross-border collaboration with our international counterparts.Lessons Learned: Uninsured Deposits and the Speed of Deposit Loss The speed of the bank runs in the spring of 2023 was unprecedented. The failure of Washington Mutual in 2008, the largest bank failure seen in the United States before this year, was the culmination of stresses that occurred over several weeks. The deposit losses experienced by SVB were much greater in both relative and absolute terms, and they occurred in less",0.10612529,0.5513256,0.34254915,negative,-0.44520032,neutral,0.7888842225074768

SVB's concentrated and highly networked depositor base of venture capital firms, portfolio companies, tech and crypto companies, and high-net-worth individuals communicated quickly with one another and, in effect, coordinated the massive and rapid run.5 And more fundamentally, as I said, SVB failed because of a textbook case of mismanagement of interest rate and liquidity risk. This mismanagement made depositors lose confidence in the bank's solvency, so they ran.The March stress also showed that contagion is possible among large regional banking organizations whose size and scope are well below those of banks that have been designated as globally systemically important. Liquidity stress at SVB quickly led other banks",0.025111372,0.9160365,0.058852166,negative,-0.8909251,negative,0.5947267413139343

But the contagion extended beyond such banks and threatened to cause disruption more broadly to regional and community banks with traditional business models and to the banking system as a whole. The Federal Reserve, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), and the U.S. Department of the Treasury stepped in quickly to stop that contagion, and the strategy worked: deposit flows returned to normal, and stress in the banking system slowly abated.This experience has changed everyone's perception of the possible",0.109151654,0.6249057,0.26594266,negative,-0.51575404,negative,0.958491325378418

What occurred in two or three weeks or, in some cases, many months in previous episodes may, in the modern era, now occur in hours. These issues are top of mind as we review and consider future adjustments to the way in which we should supervise and regulate liquidity risk.Monetization Issues We also saw during this period that firms were not as well positioned to monetize (that is, to borrow against or be ready to sell) their assets as they should have been. Many underestimated the size and speed with which liquidity needs could appear. Banks of all sizes are expected to maintain contingency funding plans (CFPs) to meet potential stressed liquidity outflows.7 In response to the Global Financial Crisis, regulators also now require large banks to maintain a",0.05801911,0.045171414,0.8968095,neutral,0.0128476955,neutral,0.7390923500061035

The March stress episode, however, highlighted the fact that, in practice, there can be operational impediments to a bank's ability to monetize its liquidity buffers in large volumes and in a rapid time frame in acute stress. In a world in which a bank run took place over a matter of weeks, it was reasonable to assume that a sufficient volume of the most liquid securities could be monetized to meet the demand for reserves associated with deposit withdrawals.But times have changed, and I see several flaws in our previous assumptions.

Second, the March stress underlined the possibility that private repo markets may not be a viable financing channel for banks that need to rapidly ramp up access, especially for banks that may not regularly transact in these markets, even if such repo markets can be a viable source of liquidity for banks that regularly tap such markets and have more gradual funding stresses. Sharp shifts in calls on private repo market capacity, particularly by firms experiencing stress, may not be easily met.In addition, it proved especially difficult to monetize assets in those cases in which firms held substantial amounts of",0.017899182,0.9369228,0.045177985,negative,-0.91902363,negative,0.9111959934234619

The experience showed that when these securities are sold and losses are realized, it understandably may send a negative signal to the market about the bank's viability. A compounding factor in these situations is that if the securities that a bank needs to sell are in held-to-maturity portfolios, the sales under acute stress can have a severe effect on the bank's balance sheet, as I discussed in a previous speech.9Discount Window Preparedness for Times of Stress While, as discussed, the discount window provides ready access to funding to help banks manage liquidity risks in normal conditions, it is also incredibly important that it be available to banks dealing with idiosyncratic or market-wide stress events.

In contrast to private-sector liquidity sources, the Fed can provide immediate liquidity against a wide range of collateral to one or a number of depository institutions simultaneously. This function provides additional time for a more orderly monetization. An update on contingent liquidity readiness that the bank regulatory agencies published in July also makes clear that all of the agencies understand the importance of a bank's readiness to make use of the discount window.10The banks that failed because of the stress event that began in March had access to, and utilized, the Federal Reserve's discount window, and their failures were the result not of lack of access to the discount window",0.06477433,0.08336594,0.85185975,neutral,-0.018591613,neutral,0.8764513731002808

That said, they also faced internal operational challenges in quickly identifying and moving collateral that would have provided them additional borrowing capacity at the discount window. While this additional borrowing capacity would not have ultimately saved these banks given the speed and the severity of their deposit outflows, the lessons from managing their stress events can help others facing less acute events. Greater operational readiness can provide for greater optionality when a bank hits a bout of turbulence. Ready access to sufficient liquidity provides breathing room for a bank to determine and execute its path forward.There are two key aspects of discount window readiness: preparedness to",0.23022538,0.027547978,0.74222666,neutral,0.2026774,negative,0.8530234694480896

In terms of preparedness, the majority of banks that are eligible to borrow from the discount window have the legal agreements in place. This is the first step. However, many of these banks had not recently tested their discount window access prior to the stress event. Engaging in testing through actual transactions at regular intervals is a key component of operational readiness. In the case of some banks, the amount of collateral prepositioned was also a tiny fraction of potentially flight-prone liabilities going into the stress event. This lack of pre-pledging is a concern for several reasons, including that certain collateral types can require more time to pledge.

But these are the very assets that would be best pledged to the discount window, so that more liquid assets are held for other uses.The Intersection of Discount Window Readiness and Existing Liquidity Regulations The existing standards that require banks to hold HQLA buffers for self-insurance are an essential element of the regulatory framework. Requirements applying to large banks, like the liquidity coverage ratio and the net stable funding ratio, have meaningfully increased the resiliency of the banking system to liquidity stress and positioned large banks to deal better with a 30-day stress period. This type of self-insurance is critical to bank resilience and to the robustness of the financial system; however, these requirements may not, on their own,",0.7305153,0.01101553,0.2584691,positive,0.71949977,neutral,0.916682779788971

The speed of bank runs and the impediments to rapidly raising liquidity in private markets that may be needed in hours rather than days suggest it may be necessary to reexamine our requirements, including with respect to self-insurance standards and to discount window preparedness. The lessons from March also indicate that some forms of deposits, such as those from venture capital firms, high-net-worth individuals, crypto firms, and others, may be more prone to faster runs than previously assumed.As I have emphasized today, and in two previous speeches, the discount window is a tool that banks can and should use to help them respond to a wide array of conditions and provide additional time for orderly monetization of liquidity buffers in private markets, but only if banks",0.12667109,0.02129565,0.85203326,neutral,0.10537544,neutral,0.5487848520278931

Given these dynamics, we are currently studying what the lessons from March, and the variability in discount window preparedness across eligible banks, mean for the safety and soundness of individual banks and for the stability of the financial system more broadly. Since March, some banks have been assessing their operational readiness to tap the discount window, particularly relative to their runnable liabilities, such as uninsured deposits, and have been taking measures to test and pre-pledge assets where possible. Banks have also been reassessing their assumptions on the liquidity value of hold-to-maturity securities, given the experiences of March.International Coordination and Cooperation Let me wrap up by sharing some thoughts with you on international spillovers to liquidity stress events.

This important update will recognize banks providing more banking services, community development financing, and volunteer work in Native communities. Another key change is that banks can now get credit for qualifying activities that take place outside of their assessment areas. What this means is that even banks whose assessment areas fall outside of Native Land Areas can receive CRA credit for activities serving those areas.The updates related to Native Land Areas provide needed clarity to recognize investment in Native communities, but there are of course many Native people who live outside of these areas.

I will also consider the monetary policy actions taken by the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) in response to these developments and conclude by highlighting several uncertainties surrounding the economic outlook and how they affect my views about appropriate monetary policy going forward. Prominent among these uncertainties are whether supply-side improvements will continue to reduce inflationary pressures; the extent to which the demand for goods, services, and labor will come into better balance with supply given the current setting of monetary policy; and the level at which the federal funds rate will be consistent with the FOMC's inflation and maximum-employment goals in the longer run.The PostaFinancial Crisis Economy and",0.117110215,0.046424173,0.8364656,neutral,0.07068604,neutral,0.9074811935424805
2023-11-28,Governor Michelle W. Bowman,2023-11-28 10:11:00-05:00,"Monetary Policy Five years ago, monetary policymakers faced a much different set of challenges than those we face today. At that time, one of the primary concerns of the FOMC was that inflation had consistently been running slightly below the Committee's 2 percent inflation target, despite years of accommodative monetary policy following the 2007a08 financial crisis and subsequent recession. More broadly, many central banks around the world were grappling with the prospect of structurally lower interest rates due to a variety of factors including demographic changes and higher savings rates, lower potential output and productivity growth, and greater investor demand for safe assets like Treasury securities.One central topic of discussion during FOMC meetings in 2018 and 2019, my first year as a Governor and permanent voting member of the FOMC, was how",0.07428031,0.7308337,0.194886,negative,-0.6565534,negative,0.8743038773536682

Bowman,2023-11-28 10:12:00-05:00,"monetary policy strategies and tools could best achieve the Committee's dual mandate of price stability and maximum employment in a world of structurally low interest rates and disinflationary forces that kept inflation persistently under the Committee's 2 percent target. Relatedly, there was an ongoing concern that the federal funds rate, the FOMC's key policy rate, was too close to the ""zero lower bound,"" which would limit the Committee's ability to respond effectively to an adverse shock by lowering interest rates. So much so that even during the economic expansion there was concern that the Fed would likely be severely limited in its ability to stimulate the economy.In 2018, the FOMC was nearing the end of a gradual monetary policy tightening cycle that had begun in late 2015.

The U.S. was also experiencing one of the longest economic expansions in its history, with consistent labor market gains for all segments of the workforce. During my first FOMC meeting in December 2018, the FOMC completed this hiking cycle by raising the target range for the federal funds rate by 25 basis points to 2-1/4 to 2-1/2 percent. The FOMC maintained this range until the second half of 2019, when the Committee reduced the federal funds rate by a total of 75 basis points in response to moderating economic growth and inflation and global economic uncertainties related to expectations of lower U.S. growth.2 Although the underlying issues were",0.39594576,0.07249835,0.5315559,neutral,0.3234474,positive,0.840789794921875

This shockacombined with the policy responses of governments and central banks around the worldadisrupted many of the economic dynamics that had influenced the economy over the past several decades.

Many critical parts of the U.S. financial system experienced significant disruption or completely ceased to function. The Federal Reserve responded forcefully to mitigate the financial market turmoil and the economic effects of the rapid shutdown of the U.S. economy. As a part of its response, the FOMC quickly lowered the target range for the federal funds rate back to 0 to 1/4 percent and began purchasing large amounts of Treasury and agency mortgage-backed securities. These purchases were initially designed to support the smooth functioning of security markets to support the flow of credit to businesses and households and, later, to provide additional monetary policy accommodation to support economic activity and labor markets.4Central banks in other countries and jurisdictions also implemented accommodative monetary policy to",0.22061165,0.091114886,0.68827343,neutral,0.12949675,negative,0.5217291116714478

In addition, fiscal authorities around the world implemented programs to support labor markets and enable household and business spending. In the U.S., these programs and policies included the Paycheck Protection Program and other CARES Act programs designed to support businesses, households, and state and local governments. These policies, combined with extremely accommodative monetary policies, bolstered private-sector and local government balance sheets. They also resulted in what has come to be referred to as ""excess savings""amoney that consumers would have spent otherwise but couldn't, given a number of physical- and supply-related constraints.The innovative approaches adopted by many American businessesaincluding shifting to online sales and complying with social-distancing requirements to meet government operating requirementsathe excess savings, and the newly introduced medical treatments supported a",0.74037856,0.02670797,0.23291343,positive,0.7136706,positive,0.8357987403869629

Strong demand, early retirements, generous fiscal support, very low legal immigration, and a mismatch between available jobs and workers all contributed to a very tight labor market. The unusually rapid rebound in economic activity, the pandemic-driven shift in consumer spending toward goods, reduced manufacturing capacity in some sectors, and supply-chain vulnerabilities led to crippling supply-chain bottlenecks in a number of areas. Eventually, given these supplyademand imbalances amid accommodative fiscal and monetary policies, inflation moved up to very high levels.By the second half of 2021, inflationary pressures intensified and became more broad based.

Of the many difficult issues the Committee faced at the time, one of the most important was whether the inflationary pressures would be persistent or resolve as supply-side pressures eventually eased.The June 2021 Summary of Economic Projections (SEP) showed the median FOMC participant expected annual personal consumption expenditures (PCE) inflation to be 3.4 percent at the end of 2021 and to settle at 2.1 percent by the end of 2022.5 Private-sector forecasters expected slightly lower inflation of 2.9 percent at year-end 2021 and projected it to be 2.3 percent by the end of 2022.6 With the benefit of hindsight, we know now that most forecasters, ourselves included, vastly misjudged the persistence of inflation at that time, with PCE inflation of 5.9 percent for both 2021 and 2022.

Of course, the inflation and labor data did not accurately reflect the economic conditions prevailing at the time and were subsequently substantially revised.

And we continued to purchase assets at the same pace as earlier in the year, although at our November 2021 meeting we announced that we would begin to slow the pace of purchases later that month and in December.9 At the December 2021 meeting, we doubled the pace of tapering, which accelerated the end of purchases to the following March.The FOMC finally raised the target range for the federal funds rate by 25 basis points and ended the purchase of Treasury and agency mortgage-backed securities at the March 2022 meeting.

However, monetary policy is not on a preset course, and I will continue to closely watch the incoming data as I assess the implications for the economic outlook and the appropriate path of monetary policy.There are several uncertainties surrounding my baseline outlook that will influence my view of appropriate monetary policy going forward. First, much of the improvement in inflation over the past year has been due to supply-side improvements, such as improving supply chains, increases in labor force participation, and lower energy prices. It is unclear whether further supply-side improvements will continue to lower inflation.

2023-11-28,Governor Michelle W. Bowman,2023-11-28 10:25:00-05:00,"Government policies such as the CHIPS and IRA Acts are supporting these shifts by encouraging greater investment in developing domestic manufacturing capacity, including for semiconductors and electric vehicle batteries. How these investments work out over time may affect the productive capacity of the U.S. economy. And while these investments have the potential to increase productive capacity, over the next few years they may also create strong demand for labor and equipment in areas without the necessary physical resources to support the development, which may increase inflationary pressures. In my view, there is also a risk that over the coming months higher energy prices could reverse some of the recent progress made by supply-side improvements to bring overall inflation down.Second, over the past year, the number of workers in the labor force has",0.36906672,0.5583443,0.07258899,negative,-0.18927759,positive,0.8873369097709656

At the same time, the average pace of job gains has slowed somewhat and vacancies have declined, a sign that labor supply and demand may be coming into better balance. However, future gains in labor force participation may be limited, since prime-age labor force participation is currently higher than pre-pandemic levels. It is also unclear whether all of the workers who retired or left the labor force during the pandemic will eventually return.We also know that pandemic-era education disruptions from school closures and remote learning resulted in extensive learning losses.

It is possible that consumption pattern changes that occurred during the pandemic will prove durable. Prior to the pandemic, goods consumption comprised just under one-third of overall consumption.

Additionally, a lack of fiscal restraint could further contribute to inflationary pressures.Another uncertainty is the reaction of economic activity and inflation to the continuation of higher interest",0.016451621,0.9364462,0.047102235,negative,-0.9199946,negative,0.8884354829788208

However, the presence of cash buyers in the housing market has lowered some of the interest rate sensitivity in the housing sector. Further, many households continue to hold significant excess savings and are realizing ongoing savings from mortgages originated or refinanced when interest rates were low.In considering business investment and interest rate sensitivity, the evidence has been mixed.14 The most recent Richmond and Atlanta Federal Reserve CFO Survey suggests that roughly 40",0.34640127,0.5002453,0.15335347,negative,-0.153844,positive,0.7101065516471863

Retail sales fell 0.1 percent, the first drop since March. Spending was down on motor vehicles, an interest-sensitive sector, which may be evidence that that the FOMC's tightening of monetary policy is having some effect. Spending was also down at gasoline stations, mostly because of a sizable decline in gas prices, often a larger factor for this segment of retail than shifts in demand. But even without motor vehicles and sales at gas stations, retail sales barely increased in October, which may reflect a broad-based moderation in demand.Beyond consumer spending, there are indications that manufacturing and non-manufacturing activity by businesses slowed in October.

After the retail sales report for October, the Atlanta Fed's GDPNow model is forecasting a 2.1 percent pace of increase for these three months, nearly identical with the actual growth rate for the first half of the year.

Private inventory investment contributed 1.3 percentage points to GDP in the third quarter and that likely won't be sustained. Inventory swings could even subtract from GDP in future quarters.One thing to bear in mind is that the GDPNow estimate does not include the effects of the auto workers strike. A range of estimates suggest the strike will cut roughly half of a percentage point off the GDP growth rate in the fourth quarter and then boost GDP in the next quarter around the same amount, so I will tend to look through the strike impact in considering the strength of economic activity.

Consumer price index (CPI) inflation for October was what I want to see. For the month, there was no inflation, prices were virtually flat, and unlike earlier moments where improvements were concentrated in some goods and services, the moderation in inflation was broadly distributed.

The FOMC raised the federal funds rate from near zero to more than 5 percent, the sharpest increase in more than 40 years, and, as some people have noted, we have seen the most rapid decline in inflation on record. Elevated inflation was partly the result of supply-side problems related to the pandemic, and some of the improvement in inflation that we have seen has been due to the easing of those problems. But most data indicators and anecdotal evidence suggests that supply side problems are largely behind us so they will provide little support in the future in returning inflation to our 2 percent goal.

However, measures of labor productivity are very noisy, and for the 15 quarters since the advent of the pandemic, productivity has increased at an annual rate of 1.4 percent, close to the 1.5 average over the past 15 years.

Long-term interest rates are still higher than they were before the middle of the year, and overall financial conditions are tighter, which should be putting downward pressure on household and business spending.

Also, it quickly became apparent that shutdowns in any one economy were exacerbated by reduced availability of supplies from other economies.Policymakers around the world faced the common challenge of supporting incomes and limiting the scarring from temporary shutdowns in activity. The response was similar across countries: fiscal support, particularly to help those most in need, although the magnitude differed, in part because of differences in fiscal space. Initially aimed at preventing sharp financial and economic deterioration, monetary policy easing was later extended to support the nascent economic recovery.

The spot price of Brent crude oil dropped from about $115 per barrel in April 2022 to just over $80 most recently. Global agricultural prices also have retreated from their peaks, though they remain elevated. These price declines occurred partly because the supply of energy and other commodities has been less disrupted than feared in mid-2022. In addition, the U.S. has become an increasingly important supplier of energy on the global market, with U.S. production of crude oil and natural gas reaching all-time high levels.Importantly, global supply chains have largely recovered from their disruptions,",0.06077033,0.8974988,0.041730907,negative,-0.83672845,negative,0.9649269580841064

This recovery has occurred both because of supply responses motivated by high prices for transportation and key inputs and because of a shift of demand from goods back toward services. One big open question we will discuss at this conference is how global supply chains have changed since the pandemic.Supply is also a significant part of the deceleration in U.S. shelter prices.

And Federal Reserve staff have done considerable work over the years to understand and quantify these two-way spillovers. I will draw on some of that work in the discussion that follows.We would expect the monetary policy of one country to have spillovers to other economies through three main channels.2The first channel works through domestic demand. Taking the U.S. as an example, when U.S. monetary policy tightens, U.S. aggregate demand slows, lowering U.S. imports of foreign products and dampening foreign gross domestic product (GDP) and foreign inflation. The second channel, the financial channel, captures the effects of the rise in U.S. longer-term yields that typically accompanies a tightening of U.S. monetary",0.06804185,0.20730571,0.7246524,neutral,-0.13926387,neutral,0.9208899736404419
2023-11-16,Governor Lisa D. Cook,2023-11-16 10:13:00-05:00,"policy. Higher U.S. longer-term yields lead international investors to rebalance their portfolios from foreign to U.S. assets, tightening foreign financial conditions and reducing GDP and inflation in foreign economies.3 The fact that the bulk of international transactions are denominated in dollars gives U.S. monetary policy an especially salient role through the financial channel.The third channel is the exchange rate channel. A surprise increase in U.S. interest rates relative to foreign rates usually leads to dollar appreciation. This currency movement lowers the prices of foreign goods and services relative to those of the U.S., thereby restraining U.S. GDP and strengthening foreign GDP. The weaker currency and the resulting higher activity abroad tend to push up foreign inflation. But for economies that rely heavily on dollar-denominated debt and have less well-anchored inflation expectations,",0.15472682,0.74307805,0.10219519,negative,-0.58835125,neutral,0.5224042534828186

So in the end, while currency depreciation unambiguously raises inflation, its effect on GDP can be ambiguous for some countries.All told, the relative strength of the three channels determines the overall sign and magnitude of the foreign effects of domestic monetary policy tightening. However, quantifying spillovers is challenging, as the magnitudes (and even the signs) through the different channels depend on a multitude of structural features of the global economy.Moreover, the size of spillover effects also depends on the drivers of the monetary policy tightening. For instance, when the tightening occurs in the context of high growth, the positive spillovers of that growth can partially offset the adverse spillovers from the tightening of financial",0.05874782,0.23624304,0.70500916,neutral,-0.17749521,negative,0.4829047620296478

The importance of the context in which monetary policy is changing is increasingly being emphasized in the literature, such as the paper to be presented in session 4 of this conference. The staff at the Federal Reserve also have looked at these differences using both event-study and model-based approaches.4An additional concern, very relevant to the current situation, is what happens when monetary policy is being tightened simultaneously across a wide set of economies. When this concurrent tightening happens, cross-border financial spillovers could amplify the effects of our respective tightening.5 Of course, when others are also tightening, each respective central bank may need to do a bit less to achieve the same outcomes because of these spillover effects.

A number of factors may be at play. Several emerging market central banks undertook preemptive rate hikes that helped limit capital outflows, perhaps avoiding worse outcomes. Effective communication by advanced-economy central banks may also have prevented greater financial market volatility. In addition, in these recent stress episodes, commodity prices were rising rather than falling, which benefited some vulnerable emerging market economies that are commodity exporters. Of course, many other (commodity-importing) economies did not have such an advantage. And some emerging market and developing economies, especially those with high dollar-denominated debt, have struggled amid high commodity prices and food",0.57543385,0.3654506,0.059115566,positive,0.20998326,positive,0.8416653871536255

As such, the Treasury market is a key component of the transmission of monetary policy for the Federal Reserve.

To start, I would say that years of very low interest rates led to complacency at some financial institutions about the degree to which banks needed to manage interest rate risk, including in high-quality liquid asset portfolios. As in the case of Silicon Valley Bank, supervisors could also have done more to act forcefully when they identified problems.2Savings soared during the pandemic as normal spending was disrupted, and government payments to households and businesses increased significantly to avert a massive economic contraction.

But investing heavily in fixed-rate, long-duration assets without appropriate interest rate risk management led to problems in some cases. As described in our Financial Stability Report, as the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) raised the policy rate to combat inflation, yields increased across the curve and some banks experienced sizable declines in the fair value of these assets.3The higher rate environment also affected the liability side of banks' balance sheets. The outflow of bank deposits into money market funds and other alternative short-term instruments, for the most part, has been and remains both anticipated and orderly. Unfortunately, a few firms had a combination of both poor interest rate risk management and weak liquidity risk management.

Last month, I outlined how the discount window is an important tool of both monetary policy and financial stability.8 It is an important tool of monetary policy because, with the primary credit rate set at the top of the target range, it supports rate control. It is also an important tool of financial stability because it provides ready access to liquidity, regardless of market conditions.

When the market is not working, such sources of funding and liquidity come under strain.The discount window, however, can play these important roles only if eligible institutions are both willing and ready to use it. This means that it is important that banks establish borrowing arrangements, pre-pledge collateral, and engage in test transactions at regular intervals.I also want to highlight the standing repo facility (SRF). The SRF was established by the FOMC to help keep the federal funds rate within the target range if pressures arise in short-term funding markets, with the rate currently set at the top of the target range.9 This facility can be useful to both primary dealers and banks because it",0.07836546,0.017297424,0.90433705,neutral,0.061068036,neutral,0.8997632265090942

It is encouraging to see an uptick in interest among banks to join the SRF as counterparties, with 10 banks onboarded as counterparties in the last year, bringing total coverage to about half the assets of the banking system. I am also encouraged to see that there is now a broader appreciation among eligible institutions that Federal Reserve liquidity facilities are an important part of making sure that firms can weather a variety of market conditions.

I am very much attuned to the important work that you're doing on uncertainty. Indeed, as a monetary policymaker, the subject is rarely far from my mind. It's not a new subject, of course. John Maynard Keynes and Frank Knight provided book-length treatments of the subject a century ago (Keynes, 1921; Knight, 1921). In addition, in 2003, Alan Greenspan observed, ""Uncertainty is not just an important feature of the monetary policy landscape; it is the defining characteristic of that landscape"" (Greenspan, 2003).Before I begin, let me remind you that the views I express today are my own and are not necessarily shared by my colleagues in the Federal Reserve System.My plan is to talk about recent advances in how to",0.048656855,0.035289567,0.9160536,neutral,0.013367288,neutral,0.9082803130149841

Jefferson,2023-11-14 10:01:00-05:00,"measure uncertainty, what may cause uncertainty, what effect uncertainty may have on economic outcomes, and the conduct of monetary policy in the presence of uncertainty.Defining and measuring uncertainty Uncertainty is not directly observable in the same way inflation and economic output are observable. It is therefore more difficult to measure. To complicate matters further, there are three related concepts that are often used interchangeably: risk, volatility, and uncertainty. According to Frank Knight, risk describes a situation in which the outcome is unknown, but the probability distribution governing that outcome is known. Volatility, often used synonymously with risk, is a statistical measure of the variation in observed outcomes. In contrast, uncertainty is characterized by both an unknown outcome and an unknown probability distribution. These concepts are used interchangeably, in part, because empirically",0.029409276,0.111733265,0.8588575,neutral,-0.08232399,neutral,0.8577987551689148
2023-11-14,Vice Chair Philip N. Jefferson,2023-11-14 10:02:00-05:00,"it can be difficult to identify them separately, and because they all capture aspects of what policymakers do not know when making decisions. Therefore, the uncertainty measures I will discuss are a mixture of these three concepts, and a theme for me will be the necessity of monetary policymakers to consider what they don't know in their decisionmaking, an argument often attributed to Friedrich Hayek (1974).Notwithstanding the difficulty in measuring uncertainty, economists have developed tools to assess it. In fact, in the past two decades, there has been tremendous growth in research devoted to the subject. In my talk today, I will focus on four broad categories of uncertainty measures: text-based, survey-based, econometric-based, and financial market-based measures.1 There have been advances in all four categories, and there are advantages and disadvantages",0.108692676,0.0248745,0.86643285,neutral,0.083818175,neutral,0.8886144757270813

Jefferson,2023-11-14 10:03:00-05:00,"to each of these measures.One example of text-based measures of uncertainty is that by Baker, Bloom, and Davis (2016), who created an uncertainty index based on the number of leading newspaper articles that contain a combination of words related to economic policy uncertainty. They showed that newspaper text-based measures are highly correlated with stock price volatility, and that higher values of these measures are associated with lower investment and employment. An advantage of these measures is that they are high-frequency, real-time measures that can narrow the type of uncertainty being measured by linking particular words regarding uncertainty to a specific topic, such as inflation or monetary policy. A limitation of these measures is that they suffer from dual causality with the economic outcomes we are trying to measure, and therefore it",0.055320367,0.12298588,0.82169384,neutral,-0.06766551,neutral,0.8321002125740051
2023-11-14,Vice Chair Philip N. Jefferson,2023-11-14 10:04:00-05:00,"is difficult to use them to ascertain what impact (if any) uncertainty has on economic outcomes. For example, does stock price volatility cause journalists to worry about uncertainty, or is the uncertainty discussed in newspaper articles causing volatility? I note, though, that this disadvantage is common to all four broad categories of uncertainty measures to greater or lesser degrees.The second set of uncertainty measures is survey based. These measures use responses to questions by households, businesses, and market participants about their forecasts and how certain they are about those forecasts. Advantages of survey-based measures are that they are explicit about the segments of society facing uncertainty, and they are relatively precise in pinpointing the horizon over which the uncertainty prevails. Disadvantages are that these measures are not necessarily timely in capturing",0.039685324,0.04827575,0.912039,neutral,-0.008590426,neutral,0.8873743414878845

In general, these calculate how far off econometric model forecasts are from actual values at each point in time. Intuitively, when uncertainty increases, it becomes harder to predict economic variables. Advantages of these measures are that they are easy to interpret and calculate and are less prone to dual causality associated with the economic outcomes of interest. Disadvantages are that they are sensitive to the choice of the econometric forecasting model used to calculate them, and their timeliness depends on the availability of the data the forecasting model uses.The last set of uncertainty measures is market-based measures, which use financial market prices",0.033049252,0.11343327,0.8535175,neutral,-0.080384016,neutral,0.8872793912887573

For example, one widely used uncertainty measure is the Chicago Board of Options Exchange's Volatility Index, the VIX, which is calculated using equity index options that measure market participants' expectations for the volatility of the S&P 500 index over the coming 30 days. The advantages and disadvantages of these measures are similar to the text-based measures: They are high-frequency, real-time estimates of market participants' views, but they suffer from dual causality with the economic outcomes we are trying to measure. An additional disadvantage is that it is often difficult to specify the type of uncertainty being measured.Current state of uncertainty Based on the range of measures discussed above, what can we say about the current state of uncertainty?

The red line is an econometric-based measure constructed by Federal Reserve Board staff (Londono, Ma, and Wilson, 2023) called U.S. economic uncertainty. According to this measure, U.S. economic uncertainty reached an all-time high at the onset of the pandemic, came down slightly after the pandemic, but has remained elevated ever since. Consistent with this measure, policymakers, including Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) participants and central bankers around the globe, have been emphasizing the elevated level of uncertainty, especially related to inflation, and the challenge this poses for monetary policy. Since the onset of the pandemic, most FOMC participants have been indicating in the Summary of Economic Projections that they view uncertainty around their forecast of personal consumption expenditure inflation to be higher than the average level of uncertainty over",0.08457854,0.7236717,0.19174978,negative,-0.63909316,negative,0.7249404191970825

The July 2023 and September 2023 issues of the Federal Reserve Beige Book, which summarizes the commentary on current economic conditions of businesses, repeat the words ""uncertain"" and ""uncertainty"" much more than the historical average and with much of the uncertainty associated with inflation.2In contrast to policymakers and commentary from businesses and the econometric-based U.S. economic uncertainty measure, the other two uncertainty measures in figure 1athe VIX index, the black line, and the news-based economic policy uncertainty measure, the blue lineadeclined quickly after the onset of the pandemic in 2020 and have remained relatively subdued since then.

This leads me to the next topics I want to discussanamely, what causes uncertainty to increase, and does it matter that the harder-to-predict outcomes are not correlated, at least for now, with a higher VIX index?What causes uncertainty to increase? Figure 2 shows the econometric-based U.S. economic uncertainty measure since 1960, scaled in standard deviations from its mean. The figure illustrates a certainty about uncertainty: Uncertainty tends to increase during recessions, the shaded gray areas in the graph.

Jefferson,2023-11-14 10:10:00-05:00,"bad eventsasuch as recessions, oil supply disruptions, terrorist attacks, wars, and pandemicsacan increase uncertainty (Bloom, 2014). First, it is easier to predict the future when ""business as usual"" prevails in a growing economy (Orlik and Veldkamp, 2022). Forecasting is harder during recessions and when bad events hit the economy. This was especially the case during the pandemic, a once-in-a-century disturbance of worldwide consequence. Some have even argued that the pandemic has caused structural changes that will make it harder to predict future economic outcomes. Second, when business is good, firms are trading actively, which helps to generate and spread information (Van Nieuwerburgh and Veldkamp 2006; Fajgelbaum, Schaal, and Taschereau-Dumouchel, 2017). Bad events disrupt trading activity and the flow of information, and this lack of information increases uncertainty.

Fourth, when business is slow, it is cheap to try new ideas and to divert unused resources to research and development; this dynamic leads to microeconomic uncertainty, which may in turn lead to macroeconomic uncertainty (Bachmann and Moscarini, 2011; D'Erasmo and Moscoso-Boedo, 2011).Of these four theoretical mechanisms, the first one strikes me as a highly likely explanation for uncertainty remaining high today. We are still learning about the effects of pandemic-specific factors on the economy. Additionally, heightened geopolitical risks have recently contributed to increased uncertainty.3In figure 3, I decompose the econometric-based U.S. economic uncertainty measure into three subcomponents to investigate which economic outcomes are harder to predict since the pandemic and after the increase in geopolitical tensions. The subcomponents",0.069920756,0.106133625,0.8239456,neutral,-0.03621287,neutral,0.6832250952720642

All three subcomponents rose significantly during the pandemic but have behaved quite differently since 2021, with inflation uncertainty becoming the dominant source of aggregate economic uncertainty, especially since the Russian invasion of Ukraine. A message one could take from this is that, through the eyes of an econometrician with a rich set of predictors, inflation over the past two years was objectively difficult to predict.The rise in inflation and inflation uncertainty in the post-COVID era has been a global phenomenon. The left panel of slide 7, figure 4.1, plots an econometric-based foreign economic uncertainty index calculated as the equally weighted average of the measures of 38 foreign countries. As in the case of",0.07343185,0.098404154,0.828164,neutral,-0.024972305,neutral,0.7759541869163513
2023-11-14,Vice Chair Philip N. Jefferson,2023-11-14 10:13:00-05:00,"the U.S. economic uncertainty index, the foreign index spikes around the Global Financial Crisis and soars around the COVID pandemic, and it has remained quite elevated since, at around 3 standard deviations from its historical mean. The right panel of slide 7, figure 4.2, shows the components of foreign economic uncertainty: inflation, the black line; labor, the red line; and output, the blue line. Again, as in the U.S., foreign inflation uncertainty has become the dominant source of economic uncertainty.What effect may uncertainty have on economic outcomes? Now that I have established that some measures of economic uncertainty are elevated, one may wonder, to what extent does it matter? Economic theory offers at least two channels for uncertainty to influence growth negatively.4 The first channel comes from the ""real options"" literature",0.0687418,0.08849646,0.84276175,neutral,-0.019754663,neutral,0.684631884098053
2023-11-14,Vice Chair Philip N. Jefferson,2023-11-14 10:14:00-05:00,"and the fact that the option value of waiting to make decisions increases with uncertainty (for example, Bernanke, 1983). According to this theory, it is optimal for firms to not invest and to not hire new employees when uncertainty is high. This lack of investment and hiring in turn exacerbates recessions. The second channel comes from the reaction of financial markets to uncertainty. Investors require compensation for higher risk and uncertainty in the form of higher risk premia, which manifests in lower equity prices, and higher borrowing costs. In the presence of financial constraints, these tighter financial conditions will reduce economic growth (for example, Christiano, Motto, and Rostagno, 2014). In addition, higher uncertainty is often accompanied by higher equity market volatility and illiquidity, which in turn exacerbates uncertainty. As I mentioned",0.04047402,0.7617627,0.19776334,negative,-0.7212887,negative,0.7595511078834534
2023-11-14,Vice Chair Philip N. Jefferson,2023-11-14 10:15:00-05:00,"earlier, the elevated econometric-based uncertainty measure this past year has not been accompanied by higher equity market volatility, as measured by the VIX index. This suggests that the economic effects of the higher economic uncertainty may be somewhat mitigated, relative to the more serious case where higher economic uncertainty is accompanied by a higher VIX index (Ludvigson, Ma, and Ng, 2021).Because uncertainty can influence growth negatively, policymakers often aim to reduce uncertainty about their objectives. One way they attempt to do this is by adopting a systematic approach to achieving their objectives, as circumstances allow. This point leads me to my final topic, the conduct of monetary policy in the presence of uncertainty.What should policy makers do when uncertainty is high? In 1967, William Brainard argued that uncertainty about the power",0.08786803,0.045499507,0.86663246,neutral,0.04236852,neutral,0.5842340588569641
2023-11-14,Vice Chair Philip N. Jefferson,2023-11-14 10:16:00-05:00,"of monetary policy implied that policy should respond more cautiously to shocks than would be the case if this uncertainty did not exist (Brainard, 1967). Brainard's attenuation principle is a classic example of what has come to be known as the Bayesian approach to uncertainty and is often cited as the foundation for gradualism in the adjustment of monetary policy: Calculate what you think your best policy response is for the economy you observeaand then do less.It is often suggested, however, that the ambiguity aversion approach to uncertainty leads to anti-attenuation. That is, in the face of uncertainty over which a policymaker is unwilling or unable to attach prior probabilities, the appropriate response is to apply stronger monetary medicine than in the certainty equivalence case. For example, as Chair Powell mentioned",0.058536697,0.07091448,0.87054884,neutral,-0.01237778,neutral,0.8379393815994263
2023-11-14,Vice Chair Philip N. Jefferson,2023-11-14 10:17:00-05:00,"in a speech in 2018 that, during crisis periods, words like ""we will do whatever it takes"" will likely be more effective than ""we will take cautious steps"" (Powell, 2018).Advocates for both approaches have their theoretical justifications. In practice, however, the best response to uncertainty can be context specific and can vary over time.5 Fortunately, sometimes the context leads to the same conclusion, broadly speaking, regardless of the approach. One case of perennial interest to central bankers is inflation persistence where both the Bayesian and ambiguity aversion approaches tend to lead to policy that is stronger than the certainty equivalent case to forestall the possibility of inflationary forces becoming embedded in inflation expectations.6Conclusions Let me end where I began. Monetary policymakers need to consider what they don't know in their decisionmaking,",0.05065609,0.046261415,0.90308255,neutral,0.0043946765,neutral,0.8977032899856567

We have long appreciated that policy decisions under uncertainty should consider a range of possible scenarios about the state, and the structure, of the economy. Economic history and recent research have sharpened some of the questions, even if they have not produced the easy policy narratives we might prefer. What is clear is that policy decisions taken under uncertainty may look quite different from those that would be optimal under certainty, and properly so.The fact that economic agents are uncertain about their environment and must learn about the economyaand policyameans that monetary policy can be a positive force in stabilizing expectations.

Of course, that remains to be seen, and we are attentive to the risk that stronger growth could undermine further progress in restoring balance to the labor market and in bringing inflation down, which could warrant a response from monetary policy. The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) is committed to achieving a stance of monetary policy that is sufficiently restrictive to bring inflation down to 2 percent over time; we are not confident that we have achieved such a stance. We know that ongoing progress toward our 2 percent goal is not assured: Inflation has given us a few head fakes. If it becomes appropriate to tighten policy further, we will not hesitate to do so.

We are making decisions meeting by meeting, based on the totality of the incoming data and their implications for the outlook for economic activity and inflation, as well as the balance of risks, determining the extent of additional policy firming that may be appropriate to return inflation to 2 percent over time. We will keep at it until the job is done.With that, I will turn to three questions that have arisen from the receding but still elevated inflation we are experiencing today.

Economic forecasters generally did not see this coming, as shown by the February 2021 Survey of Professional Forecasters, which showed core PCE inflation running at or below target over the subsequent three years.3 The real-time questions for policymakers were what caused the high inflation and how policy should react. At the outset, many forecasters and analysts, including FOMC participants, viewed the sudden upturn in inflation as mostly a function of pandemic-related shifts in the composition of demand, a disruption of supply chains, and a sharp decline in labor supply. The resulting supply and demand imbalances led to large increases in",0.03771328,0.8930767,0.06921004,negative,-0.8553634,negative,0.6224890351295471

In this view, as the pandemic abated, our dynamic and flexible economy was likely to adapt fairly quickly. Supply disruptions and shortages would diminish. Labor supply would rebound, aided by the arrival of vaccines and the reopening of schools. Elevated demand for goods would shift back to services. Inflation would ease reasonably quickly without the need for a significant policy response.4Indeed, although monthly core PCE inflation spiked in March and April of 2021, beginning in May it declined for five consecutive months, providing some support for this view (figure 2).

That lack of progress, combined with very strong demand from households, contributed to a tight economy and a historically tight labor market, and more persistent high inflation.The Committee signaled a change in our policy approach, and financial conditions began to tighten. A new shock arrived in February 2022, when Russia invaded Ukraine, resulting in a sharp increase in energy and other commodity prices. When we lifted off in March, it was clear that bringing down inflation would depend both on the unwinding of the unprecedented pandemic-related demand and supply distortions and on our tightening of monetary policy, which would slow the growth of aggregate demand, allowing supply time to catch up.

Monetary policy is in restrictive territory and putting downward pressure on demand and inflation.The unwinding of pandemic-related supply and demand distortions is playing an important role in the decline of inflation. For example, wage growth has steadily fallen by most measures since mid-2022 (figure 3), despite continued robust job gains, reflecting a resurgence in labor supply thanks to higher labor force participation and a return of immigration to pre-pandemic levels.While the broader supply recovery continues, it is not clear how much more will be achieved by additional supply-side improvements.

Supply shocks tend to move prices and employment in opposite directions, whereas monetary policy pushes each in",0.052765757,0.30777073,0.63946354,neutral,-0.25500497,neutral,0.5481753349304199

Therefore, the response of monetary policy to higher prices stemming from an adverse supply shock should be attenuated because it would otherwise amplify the unwanted decline in employment.8 In addition, supply shocks have most frequently come from the volatile food and energy categories and have passed quickly. While food and energy prices critically affect the budgets of households and businesses, the policy tools of central banks work more slowly than commodity markets move. Responding aggressively to quickly passing price increases could exacerbate macroeconomic volatility without supporting price stability.Our experience since 2020 highlights some limits of that thinking.

Supply shocks that have a persistent effect on potential output could call for restrictive policy to better align aggregate demand with the suppressed level of aggregate supply. The sequence of shocks to global supply chains experienced from 2020 to 2022 suppressed output for a considerable time and may have persistently altered global supply dynamics. Such a sequence calls on policymakers to use policy restraint to limit inflationary effects.Policy restraint in this case is also good risk management. Supply shocks that drive inflation high enough for long enough can affect the longer-term inflation expectations of households and businesses. Monetary policy must forthrightly address any risks of a potential de-anchoring of inflation expectations, as well-anchored expectations help facilitate bringing inflation back to our target.

Today, I will offer my thoughts on some of these developments, to lay a foundation for a discussion about the vital importance of the prioritization of supervisory and regulatory approaches for the banking system. As the agencies move forward with an active and potentially disruptive reform agenda, we should pause, reflect upon these changes, and ask several questions: Are these reforms efficient? In totality, do they work together to enhance the regulatory framework, resulting in a rational and efficient framework? Are the reforms within the scope of our statutory authority?

However, some components of core services inflation have picked up, and I see a continued risk that core services inflation remains stubbornly persistent. In my view, there is also a risk that higher energy prices could reverse some of the progress made to bring overall inflation down.The economy has remained strong as the FOMC raised the federal funds rate, and recent data indicate that economic activity has accelerated with real gross domestic product (GDP) growing at a 4.9 percent annual rate in the third quarter. Consumer spending has also accelerated, and the housing sector appears to be continuing to rebound.The latest employment report showed a labor market with healthy job gains.

Currently, the federal funds rate appears to be restrictive, and financial conditions have tightened since September.Some of this tightening has occurred through longer-term bond yields, which can be volatile over time as conditions change. For example, since the November FOMC meeting, the 10-year Treasury yield has declined by around 35 basis points, or a bit more than half of the increase in the 10-year yield since our September meeting. A variety of models attribute a significant portion of the increase in longer-term yields to higher term premiums.

The system is much better capitalized than after the 2008 financial crisis, with substantially more liquidity. U.S. banks are also subject to a range of new supervisory tools that did not exist prior to 2008. The current framework represents a risk-based, tailored approach, which strives to align regulation with institution and activity risk, fulfilling the congressional mandate to tailor the prudential regulatory framework.2 The current level of capital in the U.S. banking system is a strength, not a weakness, which is complemented by liquidity regulations and other prudential requirements that have contributed to the",0.29970124,0.01169983,0.68859893,neutral,0.28800142,neutral,0.7370462417602539

Context matters, and when we discuss changes to the bank regulatory frameworkaincluding through changes to capital requirementsawe need to understand the direct and indirect consequences that may result.Potential Consequences of Capital Reform One of the key questions I ask when considering regulatory proposals is whether the benefit of the change outweighs the costs of implementation, both for the financial institutions subject to the proposal and for the broader economy.On a simplistic level, higher capital levels make the banking system safer. But this must be the beginning of the analysis, not the definitive end. Increased safety comes at a cost,",0.07919484,0.029616022,0.8911891,neutral,0.049578816,neutral,0.913274884223938

Assuming this is not the desired end state of the banking system, we must evaluate a proposal's merit by thoroughly understanding the balance between these benefits and the resulting costs.As I noted earlier, the U.S. banking system continues to be much better capitalized than before the 2008 financial crisis. That capital cushion has broadly enhanced the resiliency of the banking system through business, economic, and interest rate cycles, enabling the banking system to continue supporting the U.S. economy, even throughout the pandemic and the related economic stress.While the full extent of ""costs"" under the proposal are not entirely clear, in the aggregate, those costsaincluding the direct costs experienced by banks,",0.87006253,0.011671694,0.11826576,positive,0.8583908,positive,0.8369295597076416

Capital increases of this magnitude are likely to have a detrimental impact on U.S. market liquidity and lending, and firms without sufficient scale are likely to exit certain markets. Increased capital requirements for certain types of loans may also lead to reduced credit availability or increased cost of credit, which could disproportionately harm underserved markets, businesses, and communities. Ultimately, bank customers will bear the cost of these increases.The Path Forward for Capital Reform What does the path forward entail? The agencies have received substantial initial public feedback, and in response, have extended the comment period into mid-January 2024.

These actions reflect an important recognition of the proposal's length and complexity and are certainly a positive step. While it would be impossible to highlight all the issues in the proposal that raise concerns in my remarks today, I will note several areas that will be necessary to address:Policymakers may disagree about the best choices to further supervisory goals, but we have an obligation to understand and assess the true cost of reform, going beyond the direct costs to banks and their customers to include the potential harm to U.S. bank competitiveness in the global economy. As I have noted previously, unless we consider reforms with a thorough understanding of their combined and aggregate impact on the institutions subject to the revised regulatory framework, we create a significant risk",0.19927257,0.020487659,0.7802398,neutral,0.1787849,neutral,0.6538846492767334

International bodies and agreements can help foster the creation of similar regulatory frameworks across jurisdictions. Significant banking activities occur in the international and cross-border context, and we know that financial stability risks can spread throughout global financial markets. By engaging in international coordination, U.S. regulators can promote minimum standards across jurisdictions, and these minimum standards can improve competitive equity in banking markets and make the financial system safer.While the capital proposal reflects elements of the agreed upon Basel standards, it is not a mere implementation of the",0.16511792,0.015349898,0.8195322,neutral,0.14976802,neutral,0.881971001625061

Instead, the scale of the increase is driven by deliberate policy choices to significantly increase capital requirements for U.S. banks over $100 billion, even for those that are not internationally active. As we have seen since the proposal was published, there has been growing support for improving the proposal's quantitative, analytical foundations, including the need for and impact of capital increases of this scale.Community Reinvestment Act Shifting away from capital rules, late last month, the federal bank regulators adopted a new final rule to implement the Community Reinvestment Act.

As I made clear throughout the development of the original proposal and final rule, instead of requiring these changes, community banks should have had the option, at their discretion, to opt into the new retail lending test and assessment areas, or to continue with the existing framework.

This approach will disadvantage lower-volume issuers.Retail banking is an essential, core function for many smaller issuers, so this pricing dynamic may not ultimately lead them to abandon their debit card programs.

In my view, it is essential that regulators appropriately calibrate and prioritize their supervisory and regulatory actions.

The lessons learned from supervisory failures during the bank stress in the spring clearly illustrate that bank examiners and bank management should focus on core issues, like credit risk, interest rate risk, and liquidity risk.

My reflection on the past, while idiosyncratic, is also, I believe, indicative of a through line that characterizes the division historically. For me, that past begins in 1983, when I came to the Board as a newly minted college graduate to be a research assistant (RA) in the Government Finance Section, now known as Fiscal Analysis. One of our primary tasks was to keep track of the volatile, and somewhat unpredictable, fluctuations in tax receipts. The daily numbers were transmitted not by computer, but by telephone.

The list of alternative data sources available to forecast economic outcomes seems almost endless, including social media posts and web traffic, credit card purchases, geolocation, and satellite imagery. These alternative data have transformed the way economists forecast future outcomes and measure the effectiveness of monetary policy. For example, economists can use postings to social media sites to analyze investors', journalists', and households' real-time interpretation of central bank communications.2 However, a wealth of data does not necessarily translate into better forecasts and better insights.

I have already mentioned one challenge, which is to make sure we are acquiring the right ""alternative"" data, making the right inferences, and appropriately using tools such as artificial intelligence, including machine learning, to analyze this wealth of data.

In addition, these tools are very good at data mining, which can be dangerous if it gives us the false sense that a good in-sample fit leads to a good out-of-sample forecasting model. Economists in R&S and other divisions, as well as academics, have made progress on this front, but there is room for further improvement. In addition to the challenge of how to best use these tools and data at the Fed, R&S faces the challenge of understanding what these new technologies mean for labor productivity and the economy.The other challenge I want to highlight is that of making decisions under uncertainty. This is not a new challenge, of course. John Maynard Keynes and Frank Knight provided book-length treatments of the subject a century ago (Keynes, 1921; Knight, 1921). In addition, in 2003, Alan Greenspan observed, ""Uncertainty is not",0.11428648,0.03277791,0.8529356,neutral,0.08150858,neutral,0.6469237208366394

The fact that uncertainty has been a challenge for so long makes me think that it will continue be a challenge going forward, and in the wake of the pandemic, it is highly salient.In 1967, William Brainard argued that uncertainty about the power of monetary policy implied that policy should respond more cautiously to shocks than would be the case if this uncertainty did not exist (Brainard, 1967). Brainard's attenuation principle is a classic example of what has come to be known as the Bayesian approach to uncertainty and is often cited as the foundation for the gradualism in the adjustment of monetary policy.

The first case is when attempting to avoid severely adverse events such as a financial crisis. In this situation, words like ""we will do whatever it takes"" will likely be more effective than ""we will take cautious steps."" The second case is when inflation expectations threaten to become unanchored. If expectations were to begin to drift, the reality or expectation of a weak monetary policy response would exacerbate the problem.4How to respond to uncertainty is a matter that",0.06293182,0.32289007,0.6141781,neutral,-0.25995827,neutral,0.8439041972160339

Early in my career, I examined the impact of underdevelopment in the Russian banking system on growth in post-Soviet Russia and the instability that can occur in a poorly regulated financial system. Years later, as an economist on the Council of Economic Advisers, I saw how weaknesses in the financial system contributed to instability in the euro area. These formative experiences shaped my view that the Federal Reserve's work on financial stability is critical to the well-being of households, businesses, and the broader economy.

In my view, our financial system is substantially more resilient than it was in the mid-2000s, reflecting progress by regulators and the private sector in boosting resilience. That said, we cannot be complacent, and I see some important risks.Achieving the Federal Reserve's dual mandate of maximum employment and stable prices depends on a stable financial system.2 We all saw how the Global Financial Crisis triggered the Great Recession and brought misery to countless millions who lost their jobs, homes, or investments.A stable financial system provides households, communities, and businesses with the financing they need to invest, grow, and participate in",0.24072616,0.02206081,0.737213,neutral,0.21866535,neutral,0.6187046766281128

By contrast, vulnerabilitiesathe aspects of the financial system that would exacerbate stressatend to build up over time and can be identified, assessed, and monitored. In the example of the Global Financial Crisis, although it was widely recognized that housing valuations were high, the magnitude of the ensuing price drop was unexpected, or a shock.

One hard-learned lesson of the crisis is that the Fed and other regulators must watch closely for vulnerabilities that may build up within the financial system.Based on this experience, other historical episodes, and academic research, we focus, in the Board's FSR and other work, on assessing vulnerabilities across four broad categories related to asset valuations, borrowing by businesses and households, financial-sector leverage, and funding risks. We also consider, through contacts with market participants and experts, near-term risks that, if they were to come to pass, could interact with these vulnerabilities.Asset Valuations One key set of vulnerabilities stems from valuation pressures.

When their risk appetite drives prices higher relative to economic fundamentals, there may be a greater risk of outsized drops in prices that can be destabilizing.4 The Fed looks at a broad range of asset markets, including equities, Treasury securities, corporate bonds, loans, and real estate. This table from our FSR shows the sizes of the asset markets discussed in this section as of Q2, the most recent data available. The largest asset markets are those for residential real estate, equities, Treasury securities, and commercial real estate (CRE).5This year, asset valuations have generally risen notably above their historical levels. In particular, prices of residential and commercial properties remain above levels historically associated with fundamentals. House prices, relative to rents, are near all-time highs.

I am watching closely the extent to which post-pandemic supply and demand patterns normalize. Demand in the office sector has remained weak, particularly in central business districts and coastal cities, with vacancy rates increasing further and rent growth declining. Finally, average delinquency rates for commercial mortgage-backed securities have moved up recently, as office and retail loan performance has deteriorated. If delinquency rates generate selling pressure or increase notably further and result in forced sales of properties, then CRE prices could decline sharply.Another notable market development has been the significant increase in longer-term bond yields since June.

If households or businesses borrow too much, they may be unable to service debt or could find themselves underwater if assets decline in value. Such stresses can propagate through the financial system, causing funding shortages that curtail credit and hamper economic activity. Of course, it's very difficult to tell in real time whether households and businesses are, in fact, borrowing ""too much,"" so we rely on a range of benchmarks.Currently, business debt is at historically high levels relative to such benchmarks as gross domestic product (GDP) or business assets, although those ratios are significantly lower than the record",0.027514778,0.81587803,0.15660717,negative,-0.7883633,negative,0.9584805965423584

The pass-through of higher interest rates into debt-servicing costs appears to be muted by the large share of long-term, fixed-rate liabilities. However, I note that for risky borrowers or those with high-yield or unrated debt, the ability to service their debt burdens has started to show signs of weakness, as would be expected in a rising interest rate environment, and could become further strained if corporate earnings fall due to a sharper-than-expected slowdown in economic activity.The household sector, taken as a whole, looks quite resilient.

Of course, we are seeing emerging signs of stress for households with lower credit scores, and individual borrowers may struggle with debt burdens in the face of economic hardships.Financial-Sector Leverage Now to financial-sector leverage. As I mentioned earlier, we pay careful attention to our financial system's ability to support the activities of businesses and households. When financial institutions are overly indebted, adverse shocks can cause them to retrench more than they otherwise would, resulting in greater declines in economic activity. In extreme circumstances, such effects can lead to credit crunches and widespread economic dislocations.

Starting with banks: The banking sector remains sound and resilient overall. Most banks continue to report solid capital levels well above regulatory requirements.The rise in interest rates over the past two years has contributed to robust bank profitability, as banks earned higher interest income on floating-rate loans while interest expense on many deposits remained well below market rates. At the same time, higher long-term interest rates also substantially affected the fair value of banks' holdings of fixed-rate assets.

For example, available data suggest that hedge fund leverage remains elevated, especially for the largest hedge funds. It is important to better understand how their leveraged activities could impact the functioning of underlying markets.Funding Risks Looking at funding, many financial institutions raise funds from the public with a commitment to return their money on short notice. But those institutions then invest much of those funds in assets that are hard to sell quickly or have a long maturity. This liquidity and maturity transformation can create strains across markets or institutions, particularly in the absence of a lender of last resort such as the Fed's discount window for commercial banks.In the banking industry,",0.04492088,0.31851277,0.6365664,neutral,-0.27359188,neutral,0.8724707961082458

That said, some banks have had to turn to higher-cost funding sources to make up for lost deposits and face reduced market values for investment securities.Outside of banking, we also monitor a wide range of nonbank financial institutions (NBFIs) such as money market funds, open-end funds, insurers, central counterparties, and digital assets. Many of their activities give rise to a liquidity mismatch that could amplify market stress. They have daily or frequent redemption possibilities on the liability side, while holding less-liquid assets. I think the Securities and Exchange Commission's recent reform on money market funds and proposal for open-end funds are encouraging steps toward mitigating funding risks arising from nonbanks.Salient Near-Term Risks Let me illustrate how these vulnerabilities factor into my views on the",0.3629672,0.0981014,0.53893137,neutral,0.2648658,negative,0.7513676881790161

It is crucial for relevant authorities to implement stronger oversight and appropriate prudential requirements for nonbanks.

It would be the most effective and balanced way to enhance the stability of the entire financial system.Internationally, inflationary pressures persist in advanced foreign economies and could pose risks to the global financial system.

Collectively, these factors could lead to pronounced losses among global financial intermediaries and a consequent reduction in the credit supply.In China, a further slowdown in economic growth could worsen financial stresses. Many Chinese firms, especially in the property sector, are struggling to service very high debt burdens. Local governments are also facing increasing fiscal strains.

Russia's ongoing war against Ukraine continues to weigh on many economies in a variety of ways, including sustained disruptions to regional trade in food, energy, and other commodities.

These impacts would vary based on firm-specific attributesabut not by asset size. The contemplated capital increases do not appear to be supported by facts and analysis and will likely result in significant unintended consequences.One could reasonably ask whether there is cause for such material change. Is this proposal designed to address identified regulatory deficiencies and shortcomings?The U.S. banking system remains strong and resilient.

The proposed capital increases, if implemented, would have a tangible effect on banking activities and unintendedabut predictableaconsequences.

Ultimately, bank customers will bear the cost of these increases.I do want to briefly address the role of international coordination in establishing capital standards both in the United States and around the world. International bodies and agreements can help foster the creation of similar regulatory frameworks across jurisdictions. Significant banking activities occur in the international and cross-border context, and we know that financial stability risks can spread throughout global financial markets. By engaging in international coordination, U.S. regulators can promote minimum standards across jurisdictions, and these minimum standards can improve competitive equity in banking markets and make the financial system safer.While the capital proposal reflects elements of the agreed upon Basel",0.22617204,0.014931838,0.75889605,neutral,0.2112402,neutral,0.6872586011886597

The CRA was enacted in 1977 shortly after the civil rights movement and against the backdrop of other significant federal laws designed to address financial inclusion and equal access to credit. At the time Congress passed the CRA, it found that banks had a ""continuing and affirmative obligation to help meet the credit needs"" of their local communities.3 Congress reinforced this obligation by instructing the federal financial supervisory agencies to encourage banks to help meet the credit needs of those same communities.4 As you know, my support for the important goals of the CRA did not translate into",0.29028964,0.023057528,0.6866528,neutral,0.26723212,positive,0.5928195118904114

For example, a wide range of community banksathose with more than $2 billion in assetsaare treated as ""large banks"" under the final rule, forcing these banks to comply with the same CRA evaluation standards as a bank with $2 trillion in assets.

It is not clear that interchange fees have kept up with the increasing expenses for many smaller issuers, including repeated reissuing of debit cards due to retail industry data breaches.Ultimately, the net result of this proposal may be to simply shift costs from merchants to bank customers, and to make those costs far less transparent (for example, if those costs are recovered",0.14896542,0.27751696,0.5735176,neutral,-0.12855154,neutral,0.3896566331386566

One of my key roles as a policymaker is to help determine what stance of policy will move the economy closer to that reality. To do that, I need to try to understand where the economy stands and where it is headed. And to do that, I look at a variety of economic and financial data.I have a team of advisers who help me compile and analyze data.

As you might know, my uncle Samuel DuBois Cook was a political theorist and the first African American professor tenured at Duke and at a major southern university. My family and I have many fond memories on this campus.I am also happy to be with you in the Economics Department today to discuss financial stability.1My own work as an academic has frequently reinforced the importance of financial stability in the United States and abroad.

These formative experiences shaped my view that the Federal Reserve's work on financial stability is critical to the well-being of households, businesses, and the broader economy. This is one reason I particularly value the opportunity to serve on the Board's Committee on Financial Stability.I will focus my remarks on my assessment of financial stability risks, based on the Federal Reserve's framework for monitoring vulnerabilities in the financial system. In my view, our financial system is substantially more resilient than it was in the mid-2000s, reflecting progress by regulators and the private sector in boosting resilience. That said, we cannot be complacent, and I see some important risks.Achieving the Federal Reserve's",0.20808764,0.018529998,0.77338237,neutral,0.18955764,neutral,0.8493555784225464

Consistent with this view of financial stability, our framework for how we think about this goalaas laid out in our Financial Stability Report (FSR), which was just released in Octoberadistinguishes between shocks to, and vulnerabilities of, the financial system.3 Importantly, and as we economists know, we cannot predict exogenous shocks, which are, by definition, the surprise events that will hit the financial system and economy.

In the example of the Global Financial Crisis, although it was widely recognized that housing valuations were high, the magnitude of the ensuing price drop was unexpected, or a shock. That shock was amplified by vulnerabilities that had built up within the financial system over time, including weak bank capital, excessive household debt, lax lending standards, and fragile short-term wholesale funding. One hard-learned lesson of the crisis is that the Fed and other regulators must watch closely for vulnerabilities that may build up within the financial system.Based on this experience, other historical episodes, and academic research, we focus, in the Board's FSR and other work, on assessing vulnerabilities across four broad",0.043256283,0.55267966,0.40406406,negative,-0.5094234,negative,0.8083774447441101

We also consider, through contacts with market participants and experts, near-term risks that, if they were to come to pass, could interact with these vulnerabilities.Asset Valuations One key set of vulnerabilities stems from valuation pressures. The willingness of investors to take on risks is closely related to the economic and financial cycle. When their risk appetite drives prices higher relative to economic fundamentals, there may be a greater risk of outsized drops in prices that can be destabilizing.4 The Fed looks at a broad range of asset markets, including equities, Treasury securities, corporate bonds, loans, and real estate.

The largest asset markets are those for residential real estate, equities, Treasury securities, and commercial real estate (CRE).5This year, asset valuations have generally risen notably above their historical levels. In particular, prices of residential and commercial properties remain above levels historically associated with fundamentals. House prices, relative to rents, are near all-time highs. Further, prices have started increasing again in recent months after falling for more than a year. Commercial property prices also remain high relative to rental income. I am watching closely the extent to which post-pandemic supply and demand patterns normalize. Demand in the office sector has remained weak, particularly in central business districts and coastal cities, with vacancy rates increasing further and rent growth declining. Finally, average delinquency rates for commercial mortgage-backed securities have moved up recently, as",0.21963811,0.74229115,0.03807069,negative,-0.52265304,positive,0.9491004347801208

If delinquency rates generate selling pressure or increase notably further and result in forced sales of properties, then CRE prices could decline sharply.Another notable market development has been the significant increase in longer-term bond yields since June. Decompositions between changes in expected rates and term premiums depend on the specific models and assumptions used, but I would say that an expectation of higher near-term policy rates does not appear to be causing the increase in longer-term rates.Business and Household Borrowings Valuation pressures are especially concerning if they are associated with excessive borrowing. If households or businesses borrow too much, they may be unable to service debt or could find themselves underwater if assets decline in value.

Of course, it is very difficult to tell in real time whether households and businesses are, in fact, borrowing ""too much,"" so we rely on a range of benchmarks.Currently, business debt is at historically high levels relative to such benchmarks as gross domestic product (GDP) or business assets, although those ratios are significantly lower than the record highs reached at the onset of the pandemic. However, measures of the ability of firms to service their debt remain strong overall, supported by resilient corporate profits and limited effects to date from higher interest rates. The pass-through of higher interest rates into debt-servicing costs appears to be muted by the large share of long-term, fixed-rate liabilities.

Household debt, including home mortgages, auto and student loans, and credit cards, remains at modest levels relative to GDP, and most of that debt is owed by households with strong credit histories or considerable home equity. Of course, we are seeing emerging signs of stress for households with lower credit scores, and individual borrowers may struggle with debt burdens in the face of economic hardships.Financial-Sector Leverage Now to financial-sector leverage.

When financial institutions are overly indebted, adverse shocks can cause them to retrench more than they otherwise would, resulting in greater declines in economic activity. In extreme circumstances, such effects can lead to credit crunches and widespread economic dislocations. Similarly, some institutions may be forced to rapidly deleverage, stressing markets and forcing other institutions to also pull back.The United States has a large and vibrant financial system, so it is important to assess leverage across the broad array of nonbanks and banks of all sizes that provide credit to our economy. Starting with banks: The banking sector remains sound and resilient overall.

At the same time, higher long-term interest rates also substantially affected the fair value of banks' holdings of fixed-rate assets. As we saw earlier this year, fair value losses on bank balance sheets, when combined with poor liquidity and interest rate risk management, can leave banks exposed to additional risk. While acute stresses have abated, I continue to monitor this situation closely.Some nonbanks can be quite leveraged. For example, available data suggest that hedge fund leverage remains elevated, especially for the largest hedge funds.

This liquidity and maturity transformation can create strains across markets or institutions, particularly in the absence of a lender of last resort such as the Fed's discount window for commercial banks.In the banking industry, the deposit volatility that we saw earlier this year has abated. That said, some banks have had to turn to higher-cost funding sources to make up for lost deposits and face reduced market values for investment securities.Outside of banking, we also monitor a wide range of nonbank financial institutions (NBFIs) such as money market funds, open-end funds, insurers, central counterparties, and digital assets.

An unexpected sharp increase in rates could lead to heightened volatility in financial markets, stresses to market liquidity, and downward pressures for asset prices. Losses among financial intermediaries could lead to strains and a consequent reduction in credit supply.As I said earlier, the banking sector has stabilized since the period of acute stress earlier this year, and the system as a whole has ample capital and liquidity to withstand shocks. I continue to monitor the system for signs of renewed stresses.At the same time, vulnerabilities at certain NBFIs",0.12854934,0.8335996,0.037850965,negative,-0.7050503,negative,0.9345316290855408

For example, several indicators suggest that Treasury cash-futures basis tradesatrades that involve the sale of a Treasury future and the purchase of a Treasury security deliverable into the futures contractalikely gained in popularity recently. Because the basis trade is often highly leveraged, a funding shock or heightened volatility in Treasury markets could force hedge funds to abruptly unwind their positions at potentially distressed prices.I will keep an eye on how these leveraged trades might interact with Treasury market liquidity.Last but not least, transparency is vital for financial stability",0.15511015,0.04237316,0.80251664,neutral,0.112736985,neutral,0.869348406791687

In conclusion, the financial system is substantially more resilient than it was in the mid-2000s. However, vulnerabilities have risen somewhat in recent years, as highlighted by fragilities at NBFIs, in the Treasury market, andamost notably this yearaat some banks.Our framework and assessment of financial stability vulnerabilities help us understand these issues, but I am cognizant of the limitations.

I will also focus on monitoring vulnerabilities at NBFIs and the functioning of Treasury markets.

Financial inclusion is affected by many factors, but too often the cost of a payment service is prohibitive and represents a barrier that limits access for low- and moderate-income households and small businesses.

The payments system is changing, and the agenda for the next two days indicates that this year's conference will tackle a number of topics that are central to this evolution.The Fed plays multiple important roles in the payments system. We provide key services directly to a broad set of commercial banks, credit unions, and to the U.S. Treasury. We maintain accounts for these entities, transfer funds electronically, collect checks, and distribute currency. We also supervise certain financial market infrastructure. Through these functions, we help to ensure that the U.S. payments system meets the needs of consumers and businesses.From its founding, the Federal Reserve played a central role in the payments",0.046118744,0.01976156,0.9341197,neutral,0.026357183,neutral,0.9164647459983826

Market disruptions that contributed to financial panics in the late 19th and early 20th centuries were an important impetus for the establishment and design of the Federal Reserve. During the Panic of 1907, some banks refused to clear checks from other banks, creating a crisis in depositor confidence and leading to bank failures. Paul Warburg, an influential figure in banking at the time, argued that the central bank should have a duty to ""establish and maintain a perfect system of credit, enabling the general banks to transform cash credits into actual cash with such absolute ease and certainty that the use of cash credit, instead of actual cash, will not cease, no matter what may happen.""1In 1913, Congress did just that by creating the Federal Reserve and assigning it the authority to establish a",0.07797669,0.031140957,0.8908824,neutral,0.04683573,neutral,0.8588809967041016

Shortly thereafter, the Fed established a wire transfer service known as Fedwire, and later built on that with the automated clearinghouse (ACH) service in the 1970s. With the launch of FedNow this past summer, we now have an instant payments service. Our job in providing these services and carrying out our responsibilities is to make sure the payments system functions efficiently and resiliently, promoting the kind of confidence that Warburg understood was vital.It is great to see that those of you participating in this conference are taking on the key issues of the day and pushing out the frontier of knowledge with your research.

But with just a couple minutes left before the formal proceedings start, I want to draw a connection between two topics on your agenda and two questions that I have.First, how quickly will consumers and businesses demand instant payments? As I mentioned, we recently launched FedNow, our newest payments service. In some ways, what FedNow is doing is not new because it simply executes the operations that happen between when a bank sends an authorized consumer transaction and when that transaction is cleared and settled on the other end. Some of those things happen now with ACH, but with ACH it takes longer. FedNow speeds that process up from, often, a couple days to a couple seconds from initiation to",0.042844865,0.031766858,0.92538834,neutral,0.0110780075,neutral,0.925738513469696

The launch of FedNow was just one of many steps toward a system where substantially all payments are settled instantly. Banks also have a role in moving us closer to that reality. They will have to adapt their systems to be able to connect to FedNow, and how soon they do that will depend in part on how much their customers demand instant payments.Moving on to my second question, I see that you have a session on central bank digital currency. About two years ago I posed the question: What is the fundamental market failure a central bank digital currency will solve? 2 I have yet to hear a convincing answer.

What then are the reasons that support why we should change our role to sitting out front and engaging directly with the consumers? I haven't heard a good answer to that, but I am happy to see that it is a topic being discussed in your conference.With that, I'll step away so that we can get on with the main event.

The very heart of his distinguished career has been advancing the use of informed judgment in economic policymaking.As Alan has observed, in our political economy, there exist two neighboring tribes, sharing common interests but separated by cultural and language barriers.

Meanwhile, policymakers often look across that divide desiring that academic work pay more attention to the practical realities of policymaking.Like Moynihan himself, Alan Blinder is that rare person who both transcends this barrier and recognizes its significance. As he made clear to the Senate during his confirmation process to become Vice Chair of the Federal Reserve, ""Academic economists are often aloof from practical policy debates; but I have not been.""2 And he has regularly called on his academic colleagues to ""train their powerful tools on real-world issues instead of chasing intellectual will-o'-the-wisps.""3Alan's academic work is a testimony to those principles.

I'm here to offer my thoughts on the next steps for stress testing, and in particular why using multiple exploratory scenarios will help improve our understanding of risk in the banking system.1The stress test as we know it today grew out of the 2009 Supervisory Capital Assessment Program, or SCAP, conducted in the heat of the global financial crisis. In the winter of 2008a09, markets had lost confidence in banks amid wide uncertainty about the future path of the economy and the losses banks could face. This prompted the Federal Reserve and Treasury to conduct a stress test to determine the health of the 19 largest banks under a severely adverse economic scenario and to publish the findings.

During periods of economic or financial uncertainty, stress tests can provide critical assessments of bank resilience to supervisors, the market, and policymakers.

Barr,2023-10-19 10:02:00-04:00,"function better in times of stress.3Outside of stressful periods, stress tests can help to assess sufficient capitalization and improve supervisory insight into risks. The stress test also can provide transparency into the build-up of risks across banks. In our experience, the test results have given supervisors valuable information to provide feedback to individual firms and helped the Board assess the stability of the financial system. A recent study confirms this experience, finding that banks subject to the stress test were less exposed to common systemic risks.4 In addition, the stress test helps to make capital requirements less susceptible to gaming by firms and therefore more likely to be set at adequate levels.5 This is so because the design of the scenario can change based on our observations of growing risks",0.79027975,0.012713441,0.19700679,positive,0.7775663,positive,0.8054097294807434

The scenario framework, by using parameters that become stricter when the economy is stronger, also helps to avoid exacerbating the natural tendency for banks to take larger risks during good times and become highly risk averse during bad times.6 Furthermore, stress tests change in response to improved modeling and evolving risks, so that the tests better estimate potential losses in a downturn.Over the past 14 years, we have learned from our experiences and continued to evolve the stress testing program. We have taken steps to increase the transparency of the stress testing program, including to publish an extensive description of our approach to model development, implementation, and validation, as well as our approach to scenario design.7 In connection with each stress test, we disclose a detailed summary",0.4023809,0.010254696,0.5873644,neutral,0.3921262,positive,0.579183042049408

I'll walk through three limitations and explain how they can be at least partially mitigated by incorporating multiple exploratory scenarios into our stress test program.

I'll then describe how the Federal Reserve could use the results of exploratory scenarios to help ensure the banking system remains strong and resilient, by allowing us to better understand potential risks and improve our supervision of those banks.As we move forward, we must remain cognizant that none of us can predict future stressful events and their consequences with confidence.Limitations of Stress Testing First, the current stress test uses a single scenario that is focused on a credit-driven recession and single global market shock to test the financial condition of firms.10 A single scenario cannot cover the range of plausible risks faced by all large banks. This has been confirmed time and time again, including in recent experience.The failures of three large banks",0.05948433,0.046208452,0.8943072,neutral,0.013275877,neutral,0.8743640184402466
2023-10-19,Vice Chair for Supervision Michael S. Barr,2023-10-19 10:06:00-04:00,"last spring showed that acute banking strains can emerge even without a severe recession. Yet, conditions such as those recently experienced presented challenges for the design of the supervisory stress scenario. Most notably, the Federal Reserve's stress testing policy statementawhich governs how the hypothetical scenarios are determinedarequires that the severely adverse scenario include a rapid increase in the unemployment rate to at least 10 percent, as well as steep declines in house prices. Such conditions are historically associated with subdued inflation and a fall in interest rates. The fact that significant banking stress emerged in very different conditions underscores the limitations of our current stress testing processes.We also do not take into account second-order effects of stress within the financial system, which are channels that amplify the effects of the",0.06449402,0.592804,0.342702,negative,-0.52831,negative,0.7704077363014221

A good example of this is the reaction of funding markets to stress at an individual firm or many firms. These network effects may result in losses across the system not fully captured by our stress tests. While the severely adverse scenario is calibrated to historical recessions that have included contagion, our stress tests may not fully capture the evolving interconnections in today's financial system.The second limitation involves our models. In developing supervisory models, Federal Reserve staff draw on economic research and industry practice; the models are also independently validated by a group of experts outside of the stress testing program. However, all models have limitationsathey are generally trained on historical data and therefore may not be",0.03364096,0.17802913,0.78832996,neutral,-0.14438817,negative,0.638262152671814

Barr,2023-10-19 10:08:00-04:00,"robust to structural breaks, such as a once-in-a-lifetime pandemic, or important changes in technology.11 Expanding the range of risks captured in the stress test makes models more robust to these limitations but will not address them completely.12The third limitation is how the stress test affects bank behavior. Using scenarios that test for the same underlying risks year after year could disincentivize firms from investing in their own risk management as the test becomes predictable, and may encourage concentration across the system in assets that receive comparably lighter treatment in the test. Additional exploratory stress test scenarios could allow supervisors to better probe the internal risk management of firms and assess whether they are holding sufficient capital for their risks.13 We find that firms often use a large number of scenarios",0.09293637,0.06320941,0.84385425,neutral,0.02972696,neutral,0.5821744799613953

The goal of stress testing should be to provide sufficient coverage of the types of severe but plausible scenarios that could adversely impact a bank's operations, and the combination of scenarios and shocks should be curated to achieve this goal. This doesn't imply a large number of scenarios. Given the limited number of unique bank business models and variables that drive losses, a relatively small number of scenarios may be all that is required to capture a wide range of outcomes for the banking system.14On the macroeconomic side, additional scenarios could be",0.059059087,0.019488977,0.9214519,neutral,0.039570108,neutral,0.7803870439529419

For example, instead of the usual demand-driven recession, a scenario could explore the impact of an inflationary shock to supply. Potentially, an exploratory scenario could probe the interplay between capital and liquidity, to help ensure firms understand their capital exposure to rapid changes in the composition or pricing of their liabilities.15With respect to market risk, the current single market shock used in the test is a one-time shock to several thousand variables in bank trading books. This is just one realization of a large set of risk factors that determine changes in market values.16 Using additional market shocks would help us understand how the trading books and counterparty concentrations of firms would change under a range of financial",0.030355081,0.04866715,0.9209778,neutral,-0.01831207,neutral,0.9250974655151367

This could include testing the exposure of firms to different directional risks, such as a sudden rise or fall in certain asset values, or to an unexpected divergence in values of correlated assets.17 It is particularly important for us to consider a range of market shocks because some concentrated counterparty exposures may be revealed only under certain scenarios.To advance the goal of improved testing of market risk, last year, for the first time, we introduced an additional, exploratory market shock component. As compared to the global market shock, the exploratory market shock was characterized by a less severe recession with greater inflationary pressures. As we explained in our results disclosure, banks generally looked better under the exploratory market shock, experiencing smaller trading and counterparty losses in the exploratory market",0.41461584,0.2295552,0.35582897,positive,0.18506064,neutral,0.8504548072814941

This is valuable information to us and the public, since it suggests that these banks' trading and counterparty exposures may not be an unexpected source of vulnerability during a rising inflation scenario (although that test did not explore the effects of unrealized losses from interest rate risk). The exercise also provided important insight into banks' counterparty exposures in varying conditions, since banks' largest counterparties differed between the exploratory market shock and the global market shock.Building on these experiences, the Federal Reserve is developing both exploratory macroeconomic scenarios and exploratory market shocks for next year's stress test. As I noted above, an exploratory scenario would not be used to set a firm's stress capital buffer requirement.

A current use of the stress test is to help set capital requirements for large banks to help prepare firms to withstand a severe economic recession and continue to lend and operate. The key features of the scenario used to calculate the capital requirements are generally similar from year to year. Since the stress test is used to set each firm's stress capital buffer requirement, there is a benefit to predictability so that firms are better able to conduct capital and business planning.

The use of stress scenarios and shocks that do not set a firm's stress capital buffer requirement can provide room to explore a wider range of vulnerabilities to inform risk-based supervision.

For example, the 2018 stress test revealed that one firm had highly concentrated counterparty exposures that would materialize under the hypothetical stress scenario. This led to supervisory feedback to that firm and its prompt mitigation of the concern. We should continue to enhance the feedback loop between supervision and stress testing.We can also learn from our international counterparts, who have effectively employed exploratory stress tests. Since 2017, the Bank of England has run a biennial exploratory scenario designed to explore risks not covered by their annual capital stress test.

Large banking organizations should maintain a solid line of sight into their own risks and focus their efforts to capture those risks and determine capital needs. Our stress test is designed to provide a consistent measure of risk across firms, and is not a replacement for comprehensive modeling, risk management, and capital planning by the largest banks that enable them to measure and manage their own unique risks.The Future Evolution of Stress Testing Exploratory scenarios would also allow the Board to have more flexibility in its modeling",0.18149592,0.0100216195,0.80848247,neutral,0.17147431,neutral,0.8568781018257141

These forces are now working together to bring inflation down.After peaking at 7.1 percent in June 2022, 12-month headline PCE (personal consumption expenditure) inflation is estimated at 3.5 percent through September.1 Core PCE inflation, which omits the volatile food and energy components, provides a better indicator of where inflation is heading.

The September inflation data continued the downward trend but were somewhat less encouraging. Shorter-term measures of core inflation over the most recent three and six months are now running below 3 percent. But these shorter-term measures are often volatile. In any case, inflation is still too high, and a few months of good data are only the beginning of what it will take to build confidence that inflation is moving down sustainably toward our goal.

Job openings have moved well down from their highs and are now only modestly above pre-pandemic levels. Quits are back to pre-pandemic levels, and the same is true of the wage premium earned by those who change jobs.3 Surveys of workers and employers show a return to pre-pandemic levels of tightness.4 And indicators of wage growth show a gradual decline toward levels that would be consistent with 2 percent inflation over time.5Growth To date, declining inflation has not come at the cost of meaningfully higher unemploymentaa highly welcome development, but a historically unusual one.

Financial conditions have tightened significantly in recent months, and longer-term bond yields have been an important driving factor in this tightening.

After her husband's assassination, Mrs. King carried on his work for nonviolence, civil rights, and peace, but she was particularly focused on his economic justice agenda.

That march was an extension of the 1963 March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom, which was commemorated this year for its 60th anniversary. In the following years, Mrs. King used her considerable and growing stature to advocate for a broad agenda of economic empowerment, centered around the maximum-employment guarantee that had been law for decades.

Starting in 1979, the Federal Reserve Board published the Monetary Policy Report, as required by Humphrey-Hawkins, and, along with the report's release, the Chair regularly gave testimony on the Committee's plans.

The pandemic experience abruptly changed the lives of most Americans and their families, and it has altered many long-standing economic patterns that policymakers have relied on to interpret economic developments.One example of this change is the major shift in the composition of spending by American consumers that we've seen in the past few years. In the decades before the pandemic, we observed a slow but steady decline in the share of aggregate consumer spending that was composed of goods and a corresponding increase in the share of services in total spending. In the first two years after the onset of the pandemic, the balance of spending moved back substantially toward goods and away from services, though this movement wasn't particularly",0.06721245,0.8172834,0.11550417,negative,-0.7500709,negative,0.8653775453567505

This pattern we see in the U.S. is also unusual relative to other advanced economies, where the composition of goods versus services spending appears to have returned to historical norms. There are a number of potential explanations for these newly emerging spending patternsasome that would likely be temporary, and others more lasting.

Let me share my thinking about what recent economic data can, and in some cases, cannot tell us about the outlook and the appropriate setting for monetary policy.The data in the past few months has been overwhelmingly positive for both of the FOMC's goals of maximum employment and stable prices. Economic activity and the labor market have been strong, with what looks like growth well above trend and unemployment near a 50-year low. Meanwhile, there has been continued, gradual progress in lowering inflation, and moderation in wage growth.

Either growth moderates, fostering conditions that support continued progress toward our 2 percent inflation objective, or growth doesn't, possibly undermining that progress. But which is going to giveathe real side of the economy or the nominal side?I find myself thinking about two possible scenarios for the economy in the coming months. In the first, the real side of the economy slows. This is the scenario broadly reflected in the September Summary of Economic Projections (SEP) by FOMC participants, where an easing in demand helps bring the economy into better balance with supply and allows inflation to move closer to our 2 percent objective.

In such a scenario, failing to take action in a timely way carries the considerable risk of undermining what have been fairly stable inflation expectations and possibly unwinding the work that we have done to date. Thus, more action would be needed on the policy rate to ensure that inflation moves back to target and expectations remain anchored.Before getting into the economic data, let me address the increase in medium- and longer-term interest rates that has occurred since July.

There are several factors that have been mentioned to explain this movement, including stronger-than-expected incoming data on third quarter economic activity, an increased focus on U.S. deficits and the associated increase in Treasury issuance, as well as geopolitical events and a flight to safety. Whatever the causes, I will be watching how these interest rates evolve in coming months to evaluate their impact on financial conditions and economic activity.Let's now dig into the recent economic data, starting with those on economic activity that help us get a handle on the strength of demand.

The latest consensus estimate from the Blue Chip survey of business forecasters was that third-quarter real GDP grew 3.5 percent, and the Atlanta Fed's GDPNow model is coming in even higher. We'll get a first look at the third quarter GDP number next week, but it seems clear that economic activity was substantially higher for July through September than earlier in the year.The question is whether that acceleration of real activity will be sustained. Sometimes an uptick in activity is followed by some payback, or slowdown.

Thus, we want to be careful and not pay too much attention to the specific month activity took place but instead average growth over a couple of quarters to get a clearer picture of the underlying strength of the economy.To see this point more clearly, recall that at the start of this year, personal consumption expenditures increased dramatically in the first quarter but subsequently grew less rapidly in Q2 of 2023. A similar dynamic may be playing out now. On the other hand, if the third quarter data represents the beginning of persistently stronger demand, then we can expect that strength to show up in the fourth-quarter data, including by putting upward pressure on prices, which could have ramifications for upcoming decisions on monetary policy.In thinking about these two",0.38878706,0.05659621,0.55461675,neutral,0.33219084,neutral,0.8282543420791626

Waller,2023-10-18 10:27:00-04:00,"possibilities, let me tell you how I view two key components of GDP growth this year.Consumer spending, which represents nearly 70 percent of GDP, has been quite strong thus far in 2023. While household spending has been volatile, smoothing it out over the past several quarters indicates underlying momentum. Yesterday's September retail sales data indicated continued strong spending.The solid spending in the face of tightened monetary policy suggests consumption is likely supported by households' strong balance sheets as well as confidence in future labor income. I will be watching the spending data carefully, including those that hint at a slowdown. Though hard to measure, it seems that households are drawing down their liquid assets. Some other data supporting a slowing include more use of credit cards this year and a",0.38297725,0.49853975,0.118483,negative,-0.1155625,positive,0.9513053894042969

Waller,2023-10-18 10:28:00-04:00,"return of delinquency rates for consumer loans, which plunged over the course of the pandemic, to essentially their pre-pandemic levels.2 Also, as I mentioned earlier, financial conditions have tightened considerably since July. Of course, I have been waiting a while for tightening financial conditions to cause a significant slowing of spending, and I have been consistently surprised at the resilience of consumer spending. So I will be patient in waiting for the data to document how spending evolves.Another component of GDP that I'll be watching is investment in non-residential structures. Manufacturing investment boosted real GDP growth in the first half of the year, partly driven by a surge in the construction of semiconductor and electric battery factories that began before new government subsidies were enacted and driven higher by that",0.6799603,0.17621046,0.14382923,positive,0.50374985,negative,0.5675809383392334

Recent data suggests this spending is leveling off at a new, higher level: Construction spending growth has flattened out in recent months, and so have new project starts. In addition, the considerably higher interest rates over the past three months can dampen this growth. Only time will tell whether these factors slow investment activity or whether the subsidy programs and the enthusiasm for onshore chip and battery production continue to encourage higher investment spending.Let me turn now to the labor market. Since the FOMC's September meeting, the labor market data indicate continued tight conditions. The economy created 336,000 jobs in September, a robust figure that was much higher than forecasters expected. While the previous two job reports had signaled softer job growth, revisions to those reports added another 100,000",0.05784481,0.90335774,0.038797464,negative,-0.8455129,negative,0.6829023361206055
2023-10-18,Governor Christopher J. Waller,2023-10-18 10:30:00-04:00,"jobs. While down from the elevated levels seen in the first part of last year, the latest three-month average for new jobs of 266,000 is not that much different from the three-month average at the end of 2022 of 284,000. The inference is that job growth is still exceptionally strong and hasn't slowed much this year.Other data, however, are showing some continued loosening of conditions in the labor market. For example, looking through some monthly volatility, the number of job openings for every person counted as looking for a job was 1.2 in 2019 and shot up to a peak of 2 in March 2022. As we tightened policy and put downward pressure on labor demand, this ratio fell to 1.8 at this time last year and is currently 1.5.",0.018586032,0.95925224,0.022161663,negative,-0.9406662,negative,0.8054934740066528

Looking across various measures of labor compensation, the rate of wage growth has also moderated, despite an unemployment rate that is near a 50-year low. These metrics are not yet at their pre-pandemic levels but are moving closer to levels that would be consistent with 2 percent inflation.In sum, although the labor market is showing signs of loosening by various metrics, it is still unusually tight. While I anticipate that it will continue to loosen, I will be watching closely to see that this remains true.Now let's talk about inflation.

We will get an update on personal consumption expenditures (PCE) inflation next week, but based on data we received through August, the 12-month percent change in PCE inflation was 3.5 percent and core PCE inflation was 3.9 percent.Focusing on the annualized three-month change in inflation gives a better, albeit noisy, indicator of inflation dynamics. With this measure, core CPI was 3.1 percent based on data from July through September. Core PCE, increased 2 percent based on June through August. Across the categories that make up these price indexes, one finds that more than half of them had annualized monthly price increases of less than 3 percent.Clearly, this is",0.03889773,0.86867124,0.09243102,negative,-0.8297735,negative,0.9468090534210205

Monetary policy is restrictive. Households are spending the excess saving accumulated during the pandemic and have growing levels of debt, which are likely to moderate spending growth. The increase in medium and longer-term interest rates over the past several months should weigh on both household and business spending.But, while core PCE inflation over the last three months has declined to our 2 percent target, there are a couple of reasons to be concerned that this progress might not continue. First, in the latest CPI report, despite expectations of continued deceleration, housing services prices jumped from a monthly change of 0.3 percent to 0.6 percent.

Similarly, supercore inflation, which is core services excluding housing, has continued at a robust monthly rate of about 0.5 percent the past two months. Again, this reading is not at a level needed to make progress toward our goal and we need to watch and see if these numbers indicate that inflation is reaccelerating.The second reason to be concerned is that, while there is some basis for expecting that inflation will continue to fall, let me remind you, as I have done repeatedly, that we have seen a string of good inflation reports",0.45976505,0.4443046,0.09593034,positive,0.015460461,positive,0.6870244145393372

So I will be watching the next several reports for clearer indications that inflation is on a trajectory to 2 percent.What does that mean for monetary policy? I will be looking carefully at the data to see whether the real side of the economy begins to cool off or whether prices, the nominal side of the economy, heat up. As of today, it is too soon to tell. Consequently, I believe we can wait, watch and see how the economy evolves before making definitive moves on the path of the policy rate.

But if the real economy continues showing underlying strength and inflation appears to stabilize or reaccelerate, more policy tightening is likely needed despite the recent run up in longer term rates.So I will be watching to see if core inflation comes in higher than expected, perhaps sustained by continued strength in spending and investment or, if demand and the real economy slow, moderating core inflation. My views on the appropriate path for policy will be based on a careful assessment of incoming data and financial market developments and a judgement about whether we are continuing on a path of sustained progress toward 2 percent inflation.Thank you.

For the purposes of this discussion, I will define CBDC as a new, digital form of central bank money widely available to the general public. Some refer to this as a ""general purpose"" or ""retail"" CBDC. There are meaningful differences between this type of retail CBDC and what is commonly referred to as a wholesale CBDC, which is a term some use to refer to digital central bank money used to settle large-value transactions among banks. While I will return to the concept of a wholesale CBDC in a moment, I would like to share my thoughts on the debate about the introduction of a retail CBDC in the United States.As I have noted before in other",0.049326934,0.028170902,0.92250216,neutral,0.021156032,neutral,0.9272849559783936

First: what problem is the policymaker trying to solve, and is there a more efficient way to solve it? Second: what features and considerations, including unintended consequences, should a policymaker think about before deciding to adopt a CBDC and in designing the operation of a CBDC?2On the first question, we have seen a range of arguments in the public debate about issuing a CBDC, including addressing frictions within the payment system, promoting financial inclusion, and providing the public with access to safe central bank money. These are all important issues.

Through FedNow, participating banks, businesses, and consumers can send and receive instant payments in real time, around the clock, every day of the year, with immediately available funds.FedNow, and a similar private sector service, is designed to help make everyday payments faster and more convenient, allowing consumers to instantly receive funds with same-day access, and enabling small businesses to more efficiently manage cash flows without processing delays.

These risks and tradeoffs include potential unintended consequences for the U.S. banking system and considerable consumer privacy concerns. The U.S. banking system is a mature, well-functioning, and effective system that delivers important benefits to our economy.

If not properly designed, a CBDC could disrupt the banking system and lead to disintermediation, potentially harming consumers and businesses and presenting broader financial stability risks.3 As policymakers, we would need to carefully consider how an intermediated CBDC, with private-sector service providers, could be designed in a way that maintains financial institution involvement and minimizes, or ideally, eliminates related disruptions to the broader U.S. financial system.I believe it is important to continue",0.13082999,0.028886696,0.84028333,neutral,0.10194329,neutral,0.7690350413322449

Stablecoins purport to have convertibility one-for-one with the dollar, but in practice have been less secure, less stable, and less regulated than traditional forms of money.Digital assets used as an alternative form of money and payment, including stablecoins, could pose risks to consumers and the U.S. banking system.

However, while many of these issuers are subject to state supervision, they are not subject to the full complement of prudential regulation applicable to banks like capital requirements and prudential supervision.

This approach would also allow banks to compete on a level playing field in introducing products and services to benefit consumers. This type of regulatory clarity can provide support for responsible innovation.Wholesale Payments Innovation Next, I will speak to potential improvements, including technological innovations, in wholesale payments. Wholesale payments generally refer to large-value, interbank transactions, and not consumers sending money to other consumers.

The goal is to better understand potential opportunities and risks of new wholesale payment platforms, including those built on DLT, as well as the associated risks and benefits of depository institutions transacting on these platforms with ""tokenized"" forms of digital central bank money, sometimes called wholesale CBDC.In my view, the term ""wholesale CBDC,"" despite its wide use, is generally a misnomer that leads to confusion since we already have central bank money in digital form that is available to banks for wholesale transactions.4 Today, banks and other eligible entities hold central bank money as digital balances at the Federal Reserveafrequently referred to as reserves.

Since this infrastructure is so critical to the payments system, it is necessary that we investigate and understand the potential opportunities, risks, and tradeoffs for wholesale payments innovation to support a safe and efficient U.S. payment system.

These platforms are also being explored as a way to improve the efficiency of payment, clearing, and settlement of certain financial transactions, including for cross-border purposes.Policymakers should be mindful of the specific features innovative wholesale platforms could include, and the risks, tradeoffs, and other considerations they could entail. For example, one potential model under consideration is the concept of a common platform or shared ledger that could facilitate digital asset transactions, including commercial bank and central bank liabilities.6 This type of ledger could be specific to one jurisdiction (such as U.S. dollar transactions only among regulated financial institutions) or across jurisdictions and containing multiple currencies.While there",0.10216108,0.010137099,0.8877018,neutral,0.09202398,neutral,0.7877454161643982

While my vision for responsible innovation includes a broad understanding of different options, I continue to emphasize that to help focus efforts, we must begin by asking ""What specific problem are we trying to solve?""The Importance of Policy Choices This brings me to the question of whether the potential benefits from innovation come from new technology or from changes to existing policy.

In the United States, over the past year and a half, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) has increased the federal funds target range by 5-1/4 percent and has been reducing the Federal Reserve's securities holdings, which had increased substantially during the pandemic period. We have seen some progress on lowering inflation over that time. However, inflation remains well above the FOMC's 2 percent target. Domestic spending has continued at a strong pace, and the labor market remains tight. This suggests that the policy rate may need to rise further and stay restrictive for some time to return inflation to the FOMC's goal.As they have confronted price stability challenges, central banks have also faced new financial stability risks, with",0.5856115,0.35899398,0.055394515,positive,0.22661754,positive,0.8518409729003906

It is important to monitor these evolving risks, and if necessary, take action to minimize the possible spillover effects on the wider banking and financial system.

It must go further to examine a bank's risk exposures while prioritizing core safety and soundness issues in the context of the bank's financial condition. If the supervisory process fails to identify and escalate critical risks, or to hold management accountable for known deficiencies, such as excess interest rate risk-taking, this raises the potential for supervisory shortcomings, including the ability to anticipate how the evolving macro-financial landscape can affect a bank's condition.As the regulatory framework becomes more complex, we must ensure that supervisors and examiners are adequately equipped to implement and maintain the highest quality of supervision.

Regulatory actions also have the capacity to depress economic activity through the reduced availability of credit or by limiting the availability of financial products or services. These concerns are most acute when the reforms themselves may be inefficient or poorly targeted. For example, policymakers should carefully consider whether the contemplated significant increases in capital requirements in the United States related to the finalization of Basel III capital standards meet this standard for being efficient and appropriately targeted.Regulatory approaches in the banking sector must also allow for innovation.

Many nonbank financial institutions and products are subject to differing degrees of regulation, oversight, and monitoring.

It is essential that central banks facing high inflation bring inflation back to target. A failure to do so would only lead to greater financial stability risks through less certain and unstable economic conditions and through reduced central bank credibility.It is, therefore, necessary that central banks, in collaboration with other financial regulators as appropriate, develop and use supervisory and prudential regulatory tools to promote financial stability. Effective supervision and regulation, in turn, will support the effective conduct of monetary policy in achieving central banks' macroeconomic objectives. As these issues transcend national borders, central banks and regulatory authorities must also aim to build an international perspective that is complementary to or informed by global collaboration.

In the U.S., continued dissatisfaction with economic performanceaparticularly high inflationaled to the restrictive monetary policy implemented by Paul Volcker from 1979 to 1982.

It was widely believed that the Fed had lost credibility in the 1970s in terms of its willingness to fight inflation. Chairman Volcker's actions restored the Fed's credibility. Following the Volcker disinflation, economic research focused on the idea that monetary policy strategies would be fully effective only if they were credible. This idea led to an intensified debate about ""rules versus discretion."" The issue was how to maintain the basis for U.S. monetary policy that Volcker had created.

And this approach was a key aspect of Ben McCallum's work.In the 25 years since 1998, there have been numerous changes in U.S. monetary policy arrangements. These have included several important reforms that were substantially along the lines advocated by Ben and others. In multiple ways, the FOMC's policy framework has become much more explicit. At the end of 2007, the FOMC began publishing a quarterly Summary of Economic Projections, collecting information on individual meeting participants' forecasts.

From its inception, it made the price-stability goal that is part of our congressional mandate more concrete by indicating that Federal Reserve policymakers interpret it as a 2 percent longer-run inflation rate (in the personal consumption expenditures price index). In 2011, Ben Bernanke initiated the practice of postmeeting press conferences, which under Chair Powell's leadership now follow every FOMC meeting.In the summer of 2020, FOMC participants released a revised consensus statement that further elaborated their interpretation of the dual-mandate goals of maximum employment and price stability and how the Committee would pursue those objectives. The new statement explicitly recognized the policy tools of asset purchases and forward guidance on the federal funds rate.

It might be asked whyawith price stability secured by around the mid-1990sathese formalizations were thought necessary.

The literature on monetary policy rules and on inflation targeting provided insights about how the U.S. monetary policy framework could achieve our dual-mandate goals of maximum employment and stable prices.

I believe that this guidance has made our policy actions more effective.The FOMC's Reaction Function and the Analysis of Monetary Policy Rules Forward guidance and the postmeeting statement are major means by which the FOMC is able to communicate to households, businesses, and financial markets key aspects of our reaction function.

Three key messages that McCallum stressed regarding rules have become widely accepted.The first message is that rules can be countercyclical. McCallum became interested in policy rules at a time when those rules were closely associated with what is termed ""nonactivist"" policymakingadefined as approaches that did not involve the monetary authority responding to fluctuations in real variables such as output and employment. At that time, the research literature focused on what was known as the k percent rule, implying a fixed rate of growth for the money supply. This rule was intended to pin down the longer-run inflation rate, but it precluded monetary policy responses to the state of the business cycle.

2023-10-10,Governor Christopher J. Waller,2023-10-10 10:11:00-04:00,"economists of his generation such as Stanley Fischer and John Taylor, argued that it was appropriate to consider both nonactivist policy rules and rules that were deliberately countercyclical or activist.6 A policy rule, according to this view, could respond to movements in output, employment, and inflation in a systematic way, using a formula intended to be applicable over time and in different circumstances.7 Today it is widely accepted by economists that monetary policy rules can be activist rules.A second, related message of McCallum's work was that different rule specifications can concretely characterize differences among economists on appropriate monetary policy. In the 1970s, the whole notion of policy rules was closely associated with advocates of monetarism and rational expectations, with Keynesian economics being seen as entailing opposition to policy rules.

This perspective on rules has also become standard. Indeed, the box on monetary policy rules that regularly appears in the Federal Reserve Board's Monetary Policy Report provides a menu of policy rules designed to reflect a variety of views about the appropriate formulation of monetary policy.9 Similarly, multiple rule prescriptions and the possible implications of alternative rules for economic outcomes have, for many years, been a regular part of the",0.04051758,0.035628468,0.923854,neutral,0.004889112,neutral,0.908592164516449

Even so, McCallum believed that rules provided information about the responses to the state of the economy that were likely to be associated with more successful policymaking. According to this reasoning, the prescriptions coming from policy rules provide valuable benchmarks.

Waller,2023-10-10 10:14:00-04:00,"this idea was strongly advanced by John Taylor in his 1993 paper introducing the Taylor rule.13 It's worth looking at some features of the Taylor rule, as this will help bring out the connections between the policy rules literature and Federal Reserve practice. My discussion of these features will underline the fact that it is today widely accepted that the predictability of policymakers' reaction function strengthens the stabilizing properties of monetary policy. In that sense, policymakers understand the value of making decisions in ""rule-like"" ways.First, I will discuss the Taylor rule formula's left-hand sideaits specification of the instrument. I will then turn to its right-hand sideathe target variables to which the instrument responds.The Monetary Policy Instrument As McCallum observed, ""Taylor's paper (1993) succeeded brilliantly in interesting central bankers in the consideration of",0.19867437,0.012918899,0.7884067,neutral,0.18575546,neutral,0.7184998989105225

Much monetary policy analysis in academia had considered rules in which the policy instrument was a monetary or reserves aggregate. As I expect most of you know, this was a matter on which McCallum's research had two branches. On the one hand, the rule that McCallum himself advanced in a number of papers in the 1980s and 1990s was a rule for the monetary base and was designed to improve on the k percent monetary-growth rule by introducing countercyclical responses and allowing for shifts in money demand.15 But, on the other hand, he also produced fundamental analytical work showing that interest rate rules were",0.08226534,0.029982736,0.88775194,neutral,0.0522826,neutral,0.8946576714515686

Waller,2023-10-10 10:16:00-04:00,"viable, with his 1981 paper establishing that such rules could provide an anchor on the economy's nominal variables.16 Consequently, McCallum was receptive when the Taylor rule became a baseline reaction function in monetary policy analysis.Central banks were likewise receptive to the analysis of interest rate rulesaand the Taylor rule in particular. Their favorable reaction was driven by two factors. First, after the experience of monetary targeting, central banks were disillusioned with policy analysis that was focused on monetary aggregates. Second, interest rate rules were policy relevant because these rules were expressed in terms of the short-term interest rate on which central banks actually made decisions. As McCallum put it, ""The fact is that actual central banks in industrial countries conduct monetary policy in a manner that is much more accurately depicted by",0.11758692,0.08039909,0.80201405,neutral,0.03718783,neutral,0.4196266531944275

I'll make a few remarks about considerations related to these targets.When it comes to the specification of the inflation term in a policy rule, in the U.S. case, it's important that the inflation target is consistent with our dual mandate, which includes a price-stability goal. In 1993, John Taylor suggested that a 2 percent inflation objective characterized the Federal Reserve's behavior in the early Greenspan years pretty well. This",0.057085022,0.03368687,0.90922815,neutral,0.023398153,neutral,0.9390789270401001
2023-10-10,Governor Christopher J. Waller,2023-10-10 10:18:00-04:00,"goal subsequently became official. In 2012, as I noted earlier, the Committee made a goal of 2 percent inflation its formal interpretation of the price-stability objective. The choice of a 2 percent longer-run goal reflected a broad consensus that this rate corresponded to effective price stability in the United States. Around the world, too, inflation-targeting central banks view 2 percent as the rate corresponding to price stability. The FOMC has further judged that 2 percent is the inflation goal most consistent with achievement of our dual mandate. We have reaffirmed this numerical goal repeatedly since 2012, and, in tightening monetary policy since early last year, we've made clear that we're determined to bring inflation down to 2 percent.In considering the appropriate monetary policy response needed to return inflation to 2 percent, I",0.20081905,0.12193651,0.6772445,neutral,0.07888254,neutral,0.8325926065444946
2023-10-10,Governor Christopher J. Waller,2023-10-10 10:19:00-04:00,"find it useful to draw on the findings of the policy rules literature. These findings include the ""Taylor principle"" notion that deviations of inflation from target should likely be met by a more than one-for-one response of the federal funds rateaa response that helps ensure that the real interest rate is increased in policy tightenings.19The other part of our dual mandate is the goal of maximum employment. Reflecting the fact that this goal refers to the labor market rather than economic activity, the interest rate rules considered in the Monetary Policy Report put the real target in terms of an unemployment gap, rather than an output gap. On the matter of how this rule should be used as an input into policymaking, the main thing that I would stress is that there",0.08102738,0.06806818,0.8509044,neutral,0.012959205,neutral,0.8645280599594116

As a result, caution is justified in having monetary policy responding to gap estimates. I therefore see merit in McCallum's warning against monetary policy responding strongly to the output gap.20 In this connection, Athanasios Orphanides's research suggests that estimates of the first difference of economic slack (or excess demand pressure) may be less vulnerable to mismeasurement than the corresponding estimates of the level.21 These considerations imply that the prescriptions of the first-difference interest rate ruleawhich also appear in the Monetary Policy Reportaserve as a useful crosscheck on the prescriptions of more standard variants of the Taylor rule.Conclusion Staying on the topic of policy targets, I think it is worth concluding by emphasizing an important",0.12862784,0.029613761,0.8417584,neutral,0.09901407,neutral,0.433523029088974

I will also discuss risks facing the economy. Then, I will turn to the transmission of monetary policy, including some recent evidence on a source of lagged effects of policy.

With that, let me turn to my outlook for the U.S. economy.The Inflation Outlook Even though recent inflation data have been encouraging, inflation remains too high. Over the 12 months ending in August, total Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) prices rose 3.5 percent, the black line in figure 1. Excluding the volatile food and energy categories, core PCE prices rose 3.9 percent, the red line. To better understand core inflation trends, I find it useful to look at three large categories that together make up the core PCE price index, because what has been causing inflation in each of these sectors is somewhat different. The first category, core goods inflation, the red line in figure 2, has slowed",0.09554869,0.081780806,0.82267046,neutral,0.013767883,positive,0.5206727981567383

The second category, housing services price inflation, the black line, has clearly stepped down, as was anticipated given the previous slowing of increases in rents for new tenants. In contrast, price increases for the third category, core nonhousing services, the blue line, have yet to show a significant slowdown. Since this segment accounts for more than 50 percent of the overall core PCE index, we will need to see further slowing in this area to meet our inflation objective. Nevertheless, I believe that core PCE prices will moderate further as the labor market comes into better balance.The Labor Market Despite the strong September labor market data we received last week, there is evidence that the imbalance between labor demand and labor supply",0.0715816,0.87456894,0.053849418,negative,-0.80298734,negative,0.9199846982955933

Even so, the labor market remains tight.Consistent with cooling labor demand, job openings declined by nearly 1 million from the end of January to the end of August. Nevertheless, as shown in figure 3, job openings remain about 30 percent above their pre-pandemic level. At the same time, layoffs have remained very low, and the pace of payroll employment gains remains strong, with September nonfarm payroll job gains coming in higher than expected. In addition, the unemployment rate is 3.8 percent, a level that is still near historical lows. The fact that the unemployment rate and layoffs have remained low over the past year amid disinflation suggests that there is a path to restoring price stability without the kind of",0.03380822,0.9400943,0.02609746,negative,-0.90628606,negative,0.966332197189331

For instance, since the start of the year, the prime-age labor force participation rate, shown in figure 4, has moved up further. Immigration has also picked up, further contributing to the increase in labor supply. Slowing labor demand and improving labor supply have eased pressure in the labor market, and my expectation is for further gradual easing in labor market conditions, as restrictive monetary policy continues to slow labor demand without causing an abrupt increase in layoffs or the unemployment rate.Aggregate Economic Activity Data we have received so far point to solid economic growth in the third quarter, contrary to expectations earlier this year that the economy would slow.",0.91740596,0.063512,0.019082079,positive,0.853894,positive,0.904361367225647

Despite the signs of resilience in the economy this year, some analysts expected slower economic growth this fall, which leads me to the next topic: What are some near-term risks facing the U.S. economy?Risks Facing the U.S. Economy So far, the economy has been resilient, and inflation has been subsiding; however, I attach a high degree of uncertainty to my outlook and see multiple risks.

Since energy prices are volatile, I tend to look through changes in energy prices and focus more on core inflation in my deliberations. I am mindful that persistent inflation above the Federal Open Market Committee's (FOMC) 2 percent target increases the risk that inflationary expectations become unanchored. Thus, regardless of its source, my objective is to return inflation to the FOMC's 2 percent target.I just mentioned upside risks to inflation, but there are also important downside risks to economic activity, such as the slowdown in foreign economic growth. China's economy appears to have lost momentum as real estate activity has fallen, and other indicators, including retail sales, also suggest softness in economic activity.

Higher interest rates also affect asset prices. For example, higher interest rates, all else being equal, raise the exchange value of the dollar, which then boosts imports and reduces exports. Additionally, higher interest rates, along with a higher anticipated path of policy, lead investors to discount cash flows associated with longer-term investments at higher rates.",0.16766207,0.5573733,0.2749647,negative,-0.3897112,neutral,0.5318918228149414

More on this later.In a speech last spring, I noted that we are still learning about the full effect of our policy tightening in this post-pandemic cycle.2 Thus, I am also mindful of factors that could attenuate or delay the transmission of monetary policy. One such factor is that the bulk of corporate debt issued by large firms has not yet had to be refinanced since the FOMC started to tighten monetary policy in March 2022.Large businesses rely on corporate bonds and bank loans as sources of debt financing.

This rate will likely increase next year when a larger fraction of maturing corporate bonds needs to be refinanced. Given that this additional tightening is in train, it may be too soon to say confidently that we've tightened enough to return inflation to our 2 percent target. At the same time, I will be mindful of the additional tightening in train because of our past rate hikes as I consider whether there is a need to tighten policy further in the future.

We are in a sensitive period of risk management, where we have to balance the risk of not having tightened enough, against the risk of policy being too restrictive. The balancing of these two risks was a good reason for holding the policy rate constant at our most recent FOMC meeting.As I mentioned earlier, real long-term Treasury yields have risen recently.

The financial crisis upended lives and did severe damage to the economy, causing the worst and longest recession since the Great Depression. It took six years for employment to recover, during which time long-term unemployment ran for long periods at a record high, and more than 10 million people fell into poverty. Six million families lost their homes to foreclosure. And these costs occurred even with an unprecedentedly large response by government.Research suggests the costs of a financial crisis are sizable. While estimates vary widely, the cumulative loss in economic activity is consistently estimated to lie above 20 percent of annual GDPaand in some estimates up to 100 percent of GDP.

Better capitalized banks are better able to absorb losses and continue to lend to households and businesses through times of stress, which in turn, helps to ensure that we have a healthy and strong economy.The Strength of the Initial Reforms Following enactment of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank Act) in 2010, the Board adopted an initial set of reforms to increase the quantity and quality of capital, run an annual supervisory stress test, and set a capital surcharge on global systemically important banks (G-SIBs) to reflect the greater risk these firms pose to U.S. financial stability.

This so called ""expanded risk-based approach"" would be sensitive to important drivers of credit risk but would be standardized, transparent and consistent across banks. The proposal contains adjustments relative to the international Basel Capital Accord to ensure that on average small and large banks are required to hold similar levels of capital for key credit portfolios. The large banks subject to the proposal would continue to also be subject to the same U.S. standardized approach as applicable to all firms, in order to maintain competitive equity",0.07288151,0.2553574,0.67176104,neutral,-0.1824759,neutral,0.5553309917449951

The agencies have sought comment on this approach to competitive equity in light of the U.S. standardized approach requirement and the generally higher overall calibration of the proposed requirements.Second, turning to operational risk, large banks have experienced significant losses due to operational weaknesses over the past two decades. Experience shows that operational risk is inherent in all banking products, activities, processes, and systems and that losses at the largest banking organizations can be substantial.Under the current capital rule, the very largest, most complex banking organizations calculate risk-weighted assets for operational risk using internal models. These models can present substantial uncertainty and volatility.6 In the agencies' proposal, the operational risk capital requirements would be standardized rather than modeled and would be a function of a banking",0.031797294,0.4300223,0.5381804,neutral,-0.398225,negative,0.9447792172431946

Banks at the time were undercapitalized, in particular, for the large losses that occurred in securitizations and other illiquid assets. Although the current capital rule was updated to better reflect this risk following the crisis, the current approach has some material shortcomings.

These different experiences help inform my views on the Fed's important role in bank regulation and supervision. Over the past five years, I have found that one of the most informative, enjoyable, and productive aspects of my work at the Fed is hearing from bankers about issues that are important to you, and that affect you and your customers.

As you know, at that meeting, my colleagues and I voted to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 5-1/4 to 5-1/2 percent, after raising rates sharply over the past year and a half to reduce inflation. Since then, there has been considerable progress on lowering inflation, and the FOMC has responded this year with a more gradual pace of increases. In keeping with this approach, we held the policy rate steady in June, raised it by 25 basis points in July, and then held steady again last month. Inflation continues to be too high, and I expect",0.32401448,0.049067263,0.62691826,neutral,0.27494723,neutral,0.5326024293899536

Bowman,2023-10-07 10:02:00-04:00,"it will likely be appropriate for the Committee to raise rates further and hold them at a restrictive level for some time to return inflation to our 2 percent goal in a timely way.Most recently, the latest inflation reading based on the personal consumption expenditure (PCE) index showed that overall inflation rose, responding in part to higher oil prices. I see a continued risk that high energy prices could reverse some of the progress we have seen on inflation in recent months.At the same time, the economy has remained strong as the FOMC has tightened monetary policy. Real gross domestic product (GDP) has been growing at a solid pace. Consumer spending has remained robust, and the housing sector appears to be continuing to rebound.

The average pace of job gains over the past year has slowed somewhat and the labor force participation rate has also improved over the same time frame, a sign that labor market supply and demand may be coming into better balance.The banking system continues to be strong and resilient. Banks have tightened lending standards due to higher interest rates and funding costs and in anticipation of future regulatory requirements. But despite this tightening of lending standards, there has not been a sharp contraction in credit that would significantly slow economic activity. Bank loan balance growth has slowed, but ongoing strong household and business balance sheets combined with the growing importance of nonbank lending suggest that monetary policy may have smaller effects on bank lending and the economy than in the past.Given the mixed",0.06038885,0.9029339,0.036677264,negative,-0.84254503,negative,0.5414637327194214

Since then, the GDP and employment data have also been revised. The frequency and scope of recent data revisions complicates the task of projecting how the economy will evolve. But I continue to expect that further policy tightening will likely be needed to return inflation to 2 percent in a timely way.

My colleagues and I will make our decisions based on the incoming data and its implications for the economic outlook. I remain willing to support raising the federal funds rate at a future meeting if the incoming data indicates that progress on inflation has stalled or is too slow to bring inflation to 2 percent in a timely way. Returning inflation to the FOMC's 2 percent goal is necessary to achieve a sustainably strong labor market and an economy that works for everyone.I would now like to share some views on how I see a responsible evolution of the",0.2344713,0.09513352,0.6703952,neutral,0.13933778,negative,0.5291463732719421

To frame this discussion, I would like to revisit a few of the regulatory actions the Board has engaged in over the past year. I will identify several lessons we can learn from these actions and consider how we can apply these lessons when thinking about ongoing and future reforms to the bank regulatory framework.Specifically, I would like to address three broad themes: (1) how efficiency should be a key factor in policy discussions, (2) how to think about limits on the Board's tools to implement policy decisions, and (3) the importance of due process and public engagement in rulemaking.Efficiency should play a central role in policymaking.

In June of this year, the Board, along with the FDIC and OCC, released third-party risk management guidance for banks of all sizes. While I continue to support the overarching and worthy goal of the guidance, as I noted at the time, I think the agencies lost an opportunity to maximize efficiency in the release of this guidance. The text acknowledged the need for resources to assist community banks in meeting the untailored expectations set forth in the guidance, but failed to provide those resources on a timeline that would have improved transparency and understanding among community banks. In the absence of clearly defined expectations, the regulatory agencies should have supplemented the published guidance to ensure that the smallest banks understand how to apply the guidance to their third-party",0.34900102,0.028333819,0.6226652,neutral,0.3206672,neutral,0.5099320411682129

This guidance did not meet that bar, and we should do better for the smallest in size, yet largest number, of banks.The benefits of an efficient approach extend well beyond rulemaking and guidance and apply broadly to all aspects of the Federal Reserve's approach. For example, as I noted at the St. Louis Reserve Bank Community Banking Conference earlier this week, delays in processing applications can be harmful to banks of all sizes. The Board's application review processes should support the efficient resolution of applications.3 One way the Board could do this is by improving the approach to processing applications in cases where",0.34380686,0.020179734,0.63601345,neutral,0.3236271,positive,0.5128322243690491

When the recent supervisory record addresses the concerns raised in the protest and the record is consistent with approval, the decision should be delegated to the Reserve Bank for a determination.4 Our goal should be to ensure that bona fide concerns raised by the public are appropriately considered, without resulting in unnecessary processing delays.5Another important issue relates to how policymakers should consider the limits on available regulatory tools. Before the Board uses its regulatory or supervisory authority, we need to ask a basic question: Does the Board have the legal authority to use the tool in the manner contemplated? Late last year, the Board published principles for climate-related financial risk management for large financial institutions for public comment.6 While I supported publishing the draft principles,",0.041714773,0.031904407,0.9263808,neutral,0.009810366,neutral,0.9138732552528381

Under no circumstances should the Board mandate credit allocation decisions for banksadirectly through a prohibition, or indirectly through policy tools like guidanceaand we must carefully evaluate this type of guidance with an eye toward whether the policy tool we use is appropriate in the circumstance.Another example I want to highlight is the use of conditions in applications.

During the public comment process, community banks raised substantial concerns with the proposal, specifically around the uncertainty of the rule revisions on fraud and the cost of compliance. As a result of comments raised, and my view that significant questions remained about the effect of the rule, I did not support the Board's final action.11 But a key element in that rulemaking is that banks engaged in the rulemaking process shared their feedback, especially around potential fraud concerns and the speed with which the rule mandated system",0.25587156,0.031456523,0.7126719,neutral,0.22441503,neutral,0.5756884813308716

In my conversations with state member banks over the past 12 months, many have shared their concerns about the proposed changes to the criteria for becoming or maintaining their designation as a certified community development financial institution (CDFI). While CDFI certification is the sole purview of the CDFI Fund within the Treasury Department, I appreciate the implications the recent proposed revisions to these guidelines may have on nearly 200 bank CDFIs and the communities they serve.

This finding also helps explain why community banks were able to more effectively and on a large scale implement the Paycheck Protection Program during the pandemic in comparison with large banks.As another, more recent example, a paper published last year by economist Elizabeth Berger provides additional context to the role of community banks and the policy issues currently being debated.

She found that service sector job creation is not only supported by relationship lending from local community banks but also depends on smaller, relationship lenders for growth. Her key finding is unambiguous: ""finance [providers] must be local to facilitate service job creation.""4These research findings will certainly not surprise community bankers, state bank regulators, or those who directly see the positive impact of community banks on their local communities.

This issue could be especially acute when a marketaan underserved marketais left without a community bank as a source of credit. The research highlights that a banking desert does not only affect individuals, but also can have a devastating impact on small businesses, local job formation, and local economies.One important influence on banking market competition is bank mergers and acquisitions (M&A), including the important role of regulators in reviewing and approving these transactions.

These institutions have proven to be very effective at attracting deposits from anywhere in the country and therefore clearly compete with banks in urban and rural markets across the U.S.Why is this important?In our current system, many of the competitors and new entrants that we do have (nonbanks, fintech firms, credit unions), are systematically ignored.

Many merger proposals are regularly forced to go through an extensive, lengthy, and ultimately costly review process. As we've seen in recent months, this can result in extending the processing of the underlying merger, sometimes by as much as a year. While there is a lag in the reporting of applications data, data from 2022 show that the average processing time for applications has increased significantly from 2019 through 2022 for banks of all sizes.10 Information",0.14862375,0.32421806,0.5271582,neutral,-0.17559431,neutral,0.8215140104293823

These definitions are importantathey are used to clarify which requirements and rules apply to a certain type of institution. Policymakers should strive to avoid unnecessary complexity or confusion around these thresholds.Most commonly, when we refer to a community bank, we are referring to an institution",0.031724557,0.059903346,0.90837204,neutral,-0.028178789,neutral,0.882655680179596

This threshold was referenced in several sections of the Dodd-Frank Act as a way to differentiate requirements among banks and was explicitly referred to in the subsequent Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act.15 Of course, the reality is that our regulatory system applies different rules to different institutions across a wide range of asset sizes. For example, the Community Reinvestment Act regulation includes asset thresholds well below any common understanding of what a community bank is. It simply makes sense that the definition would be rationalized across the bank regulatory framework.Are these asset size thresholds properly calibrated, and are the impacts, costs, and benefits to institutions and to customers when banks cross these different thresholds rational?

Bowman,2023-10-04 10:25:00-04:00,"incentives to promote prudent lending while appropriately balancing risk?We also need a better framework to understand whether we should move beyond simple asset size thresholds when tailoring our regulatory rules to the risks that different banks pose based, perhaps not on size, but on business model. Further, is it possible to move beyond asset size thresholds and still apply our dual banking system's tailored supervisory and regulatory approach in a way that is clear and transparent to all stakeholders?Again, research continues to show the benefits that relationship-based commercial lenders provide to communities. I believe it is of paramount importance to develop a clear and transparent framework for defining who these lenders are so we can tailor our regulations appropriately.Insured and uninsured deposits in bank funding models A second area that deserves additional research",0.15619606,0.011455045,0.83234894,neutral,0.14474101,neutral,0.7081581354141235

Much like our competition framework, we need to ensure that the framework that we put in place today supports the banking system of tomorrow and not the banking system of yesterday.With respect to deposit insurance reform, the FDIC laid an important foundation when it released its report on the Options for Deposit Insurance Reform in May 2023.16 The framework shared the FDIC's views of the pros and cons of either providing unlimited deposit insurance coverage or targeted coverage based on different account types.

There has been a lot of progress since tightening the stance of policy began last year. In August, the 12-month change in CPI inflation was about 3-3/4 percent. The Committee has raised the federal funds rate 5-1/4 percentage points while also reducing the Fed's securities holdings by about $1 trillion.

For much of our subsequent history, however, the Federal Reserve tended to consider financial stability and monetary policy separately.3 That perspective changed considerably in the years after the Global Financial Crisis, which had many implications for how we think about financial stability and the role of",0.06596395,0.06004346,0.8739926,neutral,0.0059204847,neutral,0.8262069225311279

The Dodd-Frank Act was pivotal in reducing financial-sector vulnerabilities that contributed to the crisis, as were attendant reforms to capital and liquidity rules that strengthened the resiliency of the banking system.Financial Stability Considerations in a Low-Rate Environment After the Global Financial Crisis, the Federal Reserve kept interest rates low for years to revive a badly damaged economy. Researchers, market participants, and policymakers took note of the potential for very low interest rates to encourage investors to ""reach for yield""athat is, to take increased risk in pursuing higher returns on their investments. This behavior can include taking on increased interest rate, credit, and liquidity risk. In some ways, investor reach for yield is an indication that monetary policy is helping stimulate economic activity.

As a result, more people get jobs as economic activity increases.But in that environment of record low interest rates, and with the ravages of the financial crisis a fresh memory, people rightly wondered whether the incentive to reach for yield would drive excessive risk-taking, leading to a buildup in vulnerabilities that could ultimately threaten the stability of the financial system and the economy. Were those risks so considerable that financial stability concerns should be taken into consideration in making monetary policy decisions?4 At the same time, some risks were moving outside the banking system, leading some to worry that measures to build resilience at banks would miss these risks.

The shift from an environment of generally low and slowly adjusting rates to the rapid and near-simultaneous tightening of monetary policy around the world that began last year set the stage for additional stresses in the financial system. For example, in the United Kingdom, an initial jump in the yields on longer-maturity government bonds was amplified by distress at liability-driven investment funds.

This led to widespread disruptions in the gilt market last fall, requiring the Bank of England to undertake a temporary and targeted program of purchases of long-dated government bonds.6Here in the United States, starting in 2022, the FOMC began a period of rapid and substantial increases in the federal funds target range to combat inflation that was much too high. While most banks were well positioned to handle rate increases, higher interest rates had a severe effect on the balance sheets of banks that had not managed their interest rate risk appropriately.

Deposit flows returned to normal, and the prospect of a widespread and acute bank credit contraction receded. Such a contraction could well have harmed the economy and even triggered a recession. Indeed, one recent study looked at data for 46 countries over 150 years and found that episodes of bank stress are frequently followed by significant drops in bank lending and economic activity that persist for many years.7 Despite the effectiveness of our response to the March stress events, the question again arose whether monetary policy goals were in conflict with financial stability.Given these historical experiences, I think it is particularly important that we watch closely how both monetary policy and the effects",0.033112675,0.8995996,0.06728767,negative,-0.8664869,negative,0.9540772438049316

Recent data are consistent with pressures on banks easing relative to March. Nevertheless, although deposit volatility has abated, some banks have had to turn to higher-cost funding sources to make up for lost deposits. And core loan growth appears to be relatively stagnant in banks of all sizes. While low loan growth can be explained in part by weaker demand for loans in response to higher costs of credit, it is also driven in part by banks tightening their standards, as they reported they were doing in the past several releases of the Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey on Bank Lending Practices.8As we continue to track developments, we are also continuing to learn from this episode.

It is critical that banks have enough capital to remain resilient to those stresses.

Of course, major portions of the financial sector are not subject to federal prudential regulation. As I noted in a speech on bank capital earlier this year, we also need to worry about how risk outside the banking sector can threaten financial stability, as stress in broader financial markets is often transmitted to the banking system.9 So we need to take a broad view of financial stability.Perspectives from the Literature and the Policy Debate Recent experience lines up with academic research. I see three basic findings.10 First, when financial intermediaries, such as banks, play the important role of channeling funds from savers to borrowers, they frequently do so through various forms of maturity and credit transformation. This transformation results in the creation of",0.06047499,0.021221898,0.91830313,neutral,0.039253093,neutral,0.9258992075920105

Issuing short-term, liquid liabilities (including uninsured deposits) to fund longer-term, less liquid assets is one example of maturity transformation. These assets, such as loans, can have a credit risk component as well. These types of activities are key aspects of how the financial system supports the economy. But they can also lead to a buildup of financial vulnerabilities. And, of course, banks also engage in trading activities with their own set of exposures to market risk, a concern for regulation and supervision.The second conclusion of researchers is that such financial vulnerabilities can amplify the effects of adverse shocks to the economy, as witnessed during the Global Financial Crisis.And third, there is some evidence that monetary policy can affect financial vulnerabilities. I described, for example, how a low-rate environment can affect",0.0501965,0.051876023,0.89792746,neutral,-0.0016795248,neutral,0.9061986207962036

One view is that there is often a discernable tradeoff between the objectives of monetary policy and financial stability, and that monetary policy decisions should consider the consequences for the stability of the financial system.11 Another view is that there should be a strict separation of monetary policy and financial stability policy. According to this perspective, these goals are often complementary, particularly over the longer run, and even in cases when they do clash, the conflicts are short lived and better dealt with through",0.06008339,0.14247018,0.7974464,neutral,-0.08238679,neutral,0.4844042658805847

For example, Ben Bernanke, Don Kohn, and Lars Svensson, among others, have argued that the likely costs of using monetary policy to address financial stability risks outweigh the benefits.12 My view is somewhere in the middle of these two perspectives. Let me explain what I mean.Monetary policy is a blunt tool, affecting every individual, investor, and business. In contrast, financial stability threats can emerge from discrete parts of the financial system. Correctly calibrating monetary policy to target a financial vulnerability specific to one part of the financial system is likely not possible. Moreover, a monetary policy response, even to a broad-based search for yield, might require an increase in rates so large that it causes broad-based economic harm.13 In addition, if a segment of the financial system comes under",0.06385707,0.09700454,0.8391384,neutral,-0.03314747,neutral,0.8868309855461121

Targeted supervisory and regulatory action is often more effective. If financial stress is so large that it causes a macroeconomic downturn, then monetary policy and financial stability policy are well aligned, and the objective function can be clearly defined as restoring economic growth. Therefore, monetary policymakers are generally best served by focusing squarely on their macroeconomic objectives.That said, policymakers need to be cognizant of what is happening in the financial system and of any accumulation of financial stability risks, as these risks can be a threat to achieving the dual mandate. As the first line of defense, where we have authority, supervision and regulation are best positioned to address vulnerabilities in the financial",0.09019147,0.023645323,0.88616323,neutral,0.06654614,neutral,0.8727442026138306

But sometimes they won't be. Turning back to the SVB example, the bank failed because of a textbook case of mismanagement, particularly of interest rate and liquidity risk.14 The result was that the firm's collapse created financial stability risks that required emergency intervention.Monetary policy cannot be indifferent to financial stability risks. When financial stability events materialize, they can significantly affect both the price and quantity of credit to the economy. At that point, financial stability problems become a monetary policy concern, as they can adversely affect the flow of credit to households and businesses as well as depress economic activity.As I mentioned earlier, in its deliberations about monetary policy, the FOMC considers how credit conditions are affecting the economy.

But we also need to be conscious of the inherent limits in our ability to foresee how the financial system will respond to shocks given its complexity and evolving nature. Our ability to address financial stability risks has been greatly improved by the reforms of the Dodd-Frank Act and enhanced bank capital and liquidity requirements. But we can expect that the economy remains vulnerable to unanticipated shocks that affect both financial stability and economic growth. While continuing to bolster the resilience of the financial sector where we have authority to do so, we must also continue to monitor how emerging financial-sector risks may threaten the broader economy.Concluding Thoughts on Federal Reserve Liquidity Provision I would like to wrap up my thoughts today",0.4492818,0.019843243,0.53087497,neutral,0.42943856,positive,0.9342585802078247

I will again harken back to our founding and note that providing backstop liquidity to banks is one of the original purposes of the Federal Reserve System.15Today, the discount window plays an important role. Currently, the primary credit rate, which is the rate available to banks in generally sound financial condition, is set at the top of the target range for the federal funds rate. In this way, this tool, as well as the standing repo facility, which also has a rate currently set at the top of the target range, can help keep the federal funds rate within the target range established by the FOMC if pressures arise in short-term funding markets.16 For the discount",0.06458773,0.019913087,0.91549915,neutral,0.044674642,neutral,0.9271275401115417

I have been working to ensure that eligible institutions know that supervisors expect them to be ready and willing to use the discount window. We recently published a joint-agency message on the importance of readiness to tap contingency funding sources, including the discount window.17Readiness to use the discount window is also crucial when it comes to financial stability.

As we saw in March, many banks found that having more than one option at the ready to monetize assets was important. Other sources of funds to banks, even the Federal Home Loan Banks, are dependent on private-sector financial market functioning to provide liquidity to their customers. When the market isn't working, such sources of funding and liquidity come under strain.18In contrast, even when banks find that other sources of funds are not available, the discount window can provide liquidity to every eligible institution that is prepared to use it.

The trend seems to be that regulators are engaging in supervision with a more heavy-handed approach, focusing primarily on quarterly call report data in some cases without the benefit of direct engagement with the targeted financial institutions.The Board has long found that information received outside of a regular examination may suggest the need to carefully consider whether bank ratings remain appropriate.3 But when engaging in this type of off-cycle review, we should consider whether the process is appropriately calibrated, is transparent to the financial institution, and whether it provides the financial institution the ability to engage in meaningful dialogue and discussion with examiners.

It is entirely appropriate to express concern or engage in dialogue with management, or to gain a better understanding of a bank's strategic direction or risk management approach based on reported data. Financial results are key, but in the continuum of supervision, we should not forget the value of a broader based supervisory approach that uses all available tools and considers all relevant factors.We should also carefully consider whether our approach is appropriate in the moment: Are the federal banking agencies acting in a consistent manner in their bank supervisory activities? Are federal banking agencies coordinating appropriately with state banking agencies when reviewing state-chartered banks?

Are supervisors acting pro-cyclically, or overreacting to the events of March 2023? When agencies adopt a more adversarial approach to supervision, or apply standards that are disproportionate to risk, does that negatively impact a bank's ability and willingness to engage in open communication with their examiners?Asking these questions can help us appropriately calibrate our revised approach to banking supervision and help us avoid reacting in a way that is disproportionate to an institution's risk to the banking system.Before concluding my prepared remarks, I'd like to discuss the Federal Reserve's and the other Federal banking agencies' rulemaking agenda.

I hold these communities close in my thoughts.I see two fundamental reasons why central banks should focus on Indigenous financial inclusion. The first is our responsibility to foster an economy that works for everyone. Second is the wisdom we can gain from community-led approaches to expanding financial opportunity.In order to effectively support inclusive economic growth, we need to understand the economic conditions of Indigenous communities. The Federal Reserve's ongoing research and outreach enable us to gain insight about economic barriers that Indigenous communities face. Our recent research notes several challenges, including those related to labor market conditions, affordable credit and financial services access, homeownership, and broadband access.

During the pandemic, Indigenous communities participated less in remote workawhich may, in part, reflect this lack of access. In addition to our research, we will convene a conversation among Indigenous communities, federal policymakers, and researchers to discuss the challenges and opportunities to advance broadband service networks.Our research has also shown that on average, Indigenous borrowers pay more for home loans.

Native Community Development Financial Institutionsaor CDFIsaplay a vital role in addressing this credit and financial services gap.The Federal Reserve's research and engagement efforts have significantly advanced our understanding of the economic barriers for Indigenous communities, but there is still much to learn. The Center for Indian Country Development is working to address data gaps of U.S. Indigenous populations to provide needed information to their leaders, policymakers, and practitioners to inform decisions that best serve their communities.The Center has developed datasets on Indigenous community labor market conditions, reservation profiles including key demographic and economic indicators, and a tool that identifies economic development resources and opportunities in these communities.The Center is currently developing a Native Entity Enterprise Dataset to better understand businesses owned by Alaska Native corporations,",0.1773125,0.011941709,0.81074584,neutral,0.16537079,neutral,0.6526438593864441

Above all, these datasets equip Indigenous communities with information to plan their economic futures.Financial inclusion is an important focus for central banks, and Indigenous-led approaches can help further efforts to achieve an inclusive economy. Native CDFIs serve as critical sources of credit and financial services for Indigenous communities, and their unique lending practices provide new insights about strategies to reduce loan delinquency risks. Like community banks, Native CDFIs take a holistic approach to assessing credit risk, which includes conventional measures like credit scores and community- and character-based criteria that leverage their understanding of their communities and customers.

Those at the lower end of the income spectrum tend to face the most acute hardships.We often find that renters face housing affordability challenges, in part because renters typically have lower incomes than homeowners. In addition, the median renter also tends to pay substantially more for housing as a percent of their income than many homeowners. As a result, they tend to have less room in their budgets for discretionary expenses, potentially leaving them more vulnerable to income disruptions or unexpected expenses.The most vulnerable populations faced significant risks going into the pandemic, but public policy interventions mitigated many of these risks. Some of these policies will be discussed today.The job losses experienced during the pandemic and other economic disruptions exacerbated concerns about ongoing rent affordability and delinquency, but fortunately, those did not materialize.

Were some more cost-effective than others? What are their lasting impacts on rental markets from these policies and protections? Are the lessons from the pandemic unique to that experience? Our first panel will offer insights into these questions as we think about how to prepare for future economic conditions.More recently, renters and their families have struggled with inflation. Rents also grew rapidly as we emerged from the pandemic. While rent inflation has eased, prices for renters seeking new leases grew by 18 percent in 2021 compared to 2 percent in 2019. This price growth has strained renters' budgets.

These increased cost pressures underscore the importance of the Federal Reserve's efforts to fight inflation, which can complement efforts to address other factors affecting rent prices, including increasing the supply of rental housing.The rate of rent increases has come down from the extremes of 2021 as units built during the pandemic-era construction boom have begun to hit the market. However, the most recent data show that new lease prices remain more than 20 percent higher than they were before the pandemic. This means that the average renter signing a new lease in 2023 will pay over $200 more per month on rent than they would have in 2019.

As of May, 65 percent of lower-income renters found it difficult to meet usual household expenses, 6 percentage points higher than in March but below peak levels from the summer of 2022. According to the Board's 2022 Survey of Household Economics and Decisionmaking, 17 percent of renters were behind on their rent in the prior year, up from 10 percent in 2019.

Outside of those of us who have spent many years researching the economics of innovation, it seems that AI is having a moment. The surge in excitement and trepidation about AI is palpable. Google searches for ""AI"" have tripled worldwide since 2022, fueled by the buzz about ChatGPT.

I have used it to identify demographic characteristics of entrepreneurs in my own research.2 In contrast, effective generative AI is a very recent development and seems to be a leap forward into something new. Applications of generative AI range from the prosaic, like reducing the monotony of writing routine memos, to the wonderous, like protein structure prediction and drug discovery.Of course, experts emphasize that at their core, all forms of AI are an exercise in prediction, and technically that is true.3 To the layperson, though, a chatbot that is nearly good enough",0.08993966,0.014824712,0.8952356,neutral,0.07511495,neutral,0.8584609031677246

Some of the uses of generative AI may be unsettling. For example, concerns about the ability of generative AI to impersonate individuals to harm their reputation or violate their privacy exist and are growing. Moreover, observers have noted that AI models sometimes harbor, if not amplify, the biases found in their training data, leading to malign effects on decisions about mortgage approvals, insurance rates, medical diagnoses, and even pretrial detention.4 And discrimination is not just an equity issueait also holds down economic growth, as I show in my own work.5The range of potential social effects of AI is wide, as will be explored in the next presentation.6 In general, I am optimistic",0.017647954,0.8189716,0.16338049,negative,-0.8013236,negative,0.8742178678512573

When firms deploy technologies that make workers more productive, they create the conditions for greater wage growth consistent with stable prices. And the labor market adjustment that follows as the economy adapts to technical change can affect maximum employment.AI and Productivity The impact of AI on the economy and monetary policy will depend on whether AI is just another app or something more profound. The most consequential innovations in the past have been general purpose technologies that have broadly transformed the economy over an extended period of time. We are living through the ongoing transformation fueled by electronic information technology, for example, and electrification had a similar effect in the early 20th century.

I will consider each in turn.First, is generative AI widely used? It is easy to see the potential, and we seem to be headed for widespread use. Generative AI makes communication more efficient, and nearly all human activitiesaand all industriesainvolve communication. It is true that if you let generative AI draft an email, write the minutes of a meeting, or research a topic, you will have to review, fact-check, and edit the result.

Empirical evidence is still patchy, but there is work showing that generative AI improves productivity in a variety of settings, including computer coding, customer service, language translation, and robotics.8Second, will AI itself improve steadily over time? If we look backward, we can see that although the history of the computer language models at the core of generative AI goes back at least to the 1950s, there has been an explosion of technical progress in very recent years as LLMs, or large language models, using neural networks have emerged. Whether that explosive progress can be sustained is an open question, although the concerted efforts here in Toronto and elsewhere bode well for continued innovation.

But, in reality, each new generation of chip technology represents the coordinated effort of hundreds of scientists and engineers solving seemingly intractable problems.9 Continuing advances in model architecture, data curation, and computation will be essential for the continual improvement of AI models and implementation.Third, does generative AI make R&D more productive? Some potential for efficiency improvements in the scientific process when it comes to literature review and writing is obvious. Yet AI can go much deeper, discovering patterns in data and in previous research to generate hypotheses for testing that may not have occurred to researchers.

Of course, you will get a much deeper dive into this question later this morning with the Eloundou, Manning, Mishkin, and Rock presentation. In their work, they find that 80 percent of the U.S. workforce will see at least some of their tasks transformed by generative AI. The authors of that paper do not take a stand on how fast this transformation will take place. Nor will I. However, we do know that historically the journey from innovation to productivity has sometimes been a long and uneven one. An often-cited example is the electric dynamo, which was first used in the U.S. in the 1890s but did not boost manufacturing productivity until the 1920s.10 Things now are a bit more hopeful than that example suggests, though: The lag between invention",0.08618761,0.08396891,0.82984346,neutral,0.002218701,neutral,0.8699156641960144

Even so, the full benefit of a technology only follows adoption when suitable complementary investments have been made.12 These can include changes in corporate structure and management practices, worker training, and the adjustment of the mix of capital in use. On the last point, we may have a head start, as AI will be deployed in a world with a massive stock of information technology already in place. New business formation will surely play a role as well, as historically much of productivity growth has followed from the entry of firms starting with a clean slateaand the exit of firms that were slow to adapt.13Labor Market Effects As with all",0.18706831,0.015510119,0.7974216,neutral,0.1715582,neutral,0.8472853302955627

Economic history suggests cautious optimism here. When the world switched from horse-drawn transport to motor vehicles, jobs for stable hands disappeared, but jobs for auto mechanics took their place.14 New technologies may displace some types of labor, but they can also raise the productivity and incomes of jobs they create or complement. The increase in consumption that follows may raise demand for labor overall. Nonetheless, the displacement effect might be concentrated and the productivity effect more diffuse.

There are a range of important players in the payments system and the Federal Reserve has important roles as a supervisor as well as a payments operator.Regardless of who is providing the service, our payments system needs to meet fundamental principles. Among those core principles is ensuring that the payments infrastructure supports broad access and promotes financial inclusion. Payments are essential for everyday life, and too often, low- and moderate-income households and small businesses don't have access to the payments services they need at a reasonable cost. Moreover, as the payments system evolves, it needs to provide strong consumer protections. The payments system needs to welcome competition, provide consumers with choices, and support innovation.

And more broadly, our payments system should promote efficiency, convenience, speed, low cost, resiliency, privacy, and security. Finally, our payments system must and does rely on trust, and this trust must be maintained as the system is updated. This includes trust that the payments system is not used for illicit purposes, that lawful payments will always be honored, and that neither the government nor private actors will act improperly based on use of the payments infrastructure.Not that long ago, the Federal Reserve was facilitating payments by moving bundles of checks around the country on trucks and trains!

The Fed has long operated the Fedwire Funds Service, used by banks to conduct large-value, same-day transactions among themselves. In addition, the automated clearinghouse (ACH) service supports batch payments of more modest value. While the Fedwire Funds Service and ACH transactions have served the economy well for decades, the economy has changed dramatically over that time. There is a demand for faster payments, and the Fed has recognized that today's households and businesses would benefit from ready availability of funds 24x7.So, in July, the Fed launched the FedNow Service, a new service to make instant payments secure and convenient.

Last month, the Federal Reserve announced that it has created a novel activities supervision program to focus on the supervision of risks posed by novel, technology-driven activities at banks.1 At present, these activities include those involving crypto-assets, distributed ledger technology, and complex technology-driven bank partnerships with nonbank fintechs.

When an asset is pegged to a government-issued currency, it is a form of private money.

By the time the Federal Open Market Committee raised the policy rate in March 2022, it was clear that bringing down inflation would depend on both the unwinding of the unprecedented pandemic-related demand and supply distortions and on our tightening of monetary policy, which would slow the growth of aggregate demand, allowing supply time to catch up.

The motor vehicle sector provides a good illustration. Earlier in the pandemic, demand for vehicles rose sharply, supported by low interest rates, fiscal transfers, curtailed spending on in-person services, and shifts in preference away from using public transportation and from living in cities. But because of a shortage of semiconductors, vehicle supply actually fell. Vehicle prices spiked, and a large pool of pent-up demand emerged.

Core goods prices fell the past two months, but on a 12-month basis, core goods inflation remains well above its pre-pandemic level.

While nominal wage growth must ultimately slow to a rate that is consistent with 2 percent inflation, what matters for households is real wage growth.

We are committed to achieving and sustaining a stance of monetary policy that is sufficiently restrictive to bring inflation down to that level over time. It is challenging, of course, to know in real time when such a stance has been achieved. There are some challenges that are common to all tightening cycles. For example, real interest rates are now positive and well above mainstream estimates of the neutral policy rate. We see the current stance of policy as restrictive, putting downward pressure on economic activity, hiring, and inflation.

Since the symposium a year ago, the Committee has raised the policy rate by 300 basis points, including 100 basis points over the past seven months. And we have substantially reduced the size of our securities holdings. The wide range of estimates of these lags suggests that there may be significant further drag in the pipeline.Beyond these traditional sources of policy uncertainty, the supply and demand dislocations unique to this cycle raise further complications through their effects on inflation and labor market dynamics.

Doing too little could allow above-target inflation to become entrenched and ultimately require monetary policy to wring more persistent inflation from the economy at a high cost to employment. Doing too much could also do unnecessary harm to the economy.Conclusion As is often the case, we are navigating by the stars under cloudy skies.

Like many families during the pandemic, my family faced challenges with school closures and a lack of access to normal childhood activities and social interactions. As our education system works to address the lasting impacts of student learning losses and the increased emergence of mental health issues, it is critical that we recognize the challenges many are facing as they prepare to enter the workforce.The pandemic was a very difficult period for young people and their parents, many of whom were forced to choose between continuing to work and caring for their children.

Of course, monetary policy is not on a pre-set path, and I will be closely monitoring the incoming data and their implications for the economic outlook.

Over the past few years, for many, wage and salary increases have not kept up with inflation, and while that general pattern has improved recently, most workers still have not seen wage increases equal to price increases. For workers at the lower end of the wage spectrum, wage gains have been the strongest seen in decades. However, because necessities like groceries and gasoline make up a large share of their household expenses, lower-wage workers have been experiencing the effects of higher prices more acutely than others. We also know from history that a slower economy, with higher unemployment, tends to hit lower-income workers the hardest, so we must remain attuned to the fact that our efforts to reduce inflation have the potential to",0.2411845,0.65576434,0.103051096,negative,-0.41457984,negative,0.5539629459381104

One noteworthy development is the remarkable surge in entrepreneurship, as evidenced by a significant number of new business start-ups.

Most recently, after more than six months of stubbornly high readings, the June consumer price index showed lower core inflation, a measure that excludes food and energy prices. While this development is a positive sign that monetary policy is contributing to lower inflation, both total and core inflation remain well above our 2 percent target.At the same time, the economy and the labor market have remained strong as the FOMC has tightened monetary policy. Real gross domestic product grew slightly more than 2 percent at an annual rate in the first half of the year, well above many forecasters' expectations.

We evaluate fair lending at each consumer compliance exam and engage a specialized team of lawyers, economists, and analysts to help ensure we evaluate fair lending issues thoroughly and consistently across firms. In these examinations, we evaluate the potential for discriminatory conduct based on the lending activities of the institution and the risk that discriminatory conduct may occur with respect to",0.107576825,0.018131822,0.87429136,neutral,0.089445,neutral,0.8371673822402954

Use of machine learning or other artificial intelligence may perpetuate or even amplify bias or inaccuracies inherent in the data used to train the system or make incorrect predictions if that data set is incomplete or nonrepresentative.6 There are also risks that the data points used could be correlated with a protected class and lack a sufficient nexus to creditworthiness.For instance, digital redlining in marketingathe use of criteria to exclude majority-minority communities or minority applicationsais one risk, and it has already been the subject of several settlements, including one several years ago involving the NFHA and Facebook.7 Digital redlining may result if advertisers select their audiences based",0.015618314,0.78271127,0.20167038,negative,-0.76709294,negative,0.7439175844192505

The guidance describes how financial institutions may incorporate ""reconsiderations of value"" into their processes and controls around home appraisals.13 Deficient collateral valuations can contain inaccuracies because of errors, omissions, or discrimination that affects the value of the appraisal, and a reconsideration of value may help to properly value the real estate.

Based only on the economic data that was coming in showing a tight labor market and stubbornly high inflation, I believe that raising the policy rate 25 basis points was justified. However, I had lingering doubts about when or if an abrupt tightening of credit conditions would occur. I viewed the lingering effects of the banking stresses from March as a downside risk to cause a tightening of credit conditions. Although there did not appear to be a lot of evidence that a substantial credit crunch was in the works, I felt that waiting another six weeks was prudent risk management.

Early in March, prior to the March FOMC meeting, I had planned to raise my terminal rate 50 basis points given the hot data that had come in at that point. But then came the turmoil in the banking sector. My thought was that credit conditions were going to tighten a lot as a result of the banking turmoil. I believed this tightening would effectively replace some of the tightening that otherwise would have been needed through monetary policy.

As reported in the minutes of various FOMC meetings, the Committee often discusses these lags. There is a wide range of views among researchers and policymakers as to how long it takes for the full effect of monetary policy to register in the economy.What I would like to discuss is expectations for how long it will take for last year's sizable monetary policy tightening to show up in the economic data. While there is no consensus on an exact length of time, traditional rules of thumb say that the maximum effect of an unexpected policy change, what economists call a ""shock,"" on the real",0.029794972,0.16110344,0.8091016,neutral,-0.13130847,neutral,0.870624303817749

Furthermore, commentary sometimes treats lagged effects as a ""Wile E. Coyote"" moment where nothing happens for a long time and then whamaoff the cliff we go as the full force of past policy actions suddenly take effect.When considering applying this 12- to 24-month rule to last year's policy actions, we need to ask two questions: (1) When did the policy shock occur? (2) Does the size of the shock matter? What I want to do in the next few minutes is push back against the view that the bulk of the effects from last year's policy hikes have yet to hit the economy.Let me start by setting the stage with how the economic models that estimate",0.041528605,0.09973228,0.85873914,neutral,-0.058203675,neutral,0.8056538701057434

Economists typically use linear or log-linear statistical models that capture how past changes in a variable affect the current realization of that variable. The impact of past realizations of an economic variable on current values is estimated using constant coefficients. For example, if gross domestic product (GDP) increased at a 1 percent annual rate last quarter, a model might estimate that 0.9 of that increase will carry through to GDP in the current quarter and .8 of it will carry forward into the next quarter. These estimates of 0.9 and 0.8 are constant across time and are independent of how big the change is in GDP last quarteraif last quarter's GDP increased at",0.051556267,0.07104428,0.87739944,neutral,-0.019488014,neutral,0.8598821759223938

In short, the speed at which past changes feed into current and future values does not change over time and does not depend on the size of past changes.Once these models are estimated using historical data, the policy exercise then is to feed an unexpected, temporary 25 basis point increase in the federal funds rate into this system of linear equations and simulate the effects on key economic variables. The idea is to capture a causal response of the economy to the policy shock. Based on this process, we can trace out the change over time in a variable, say GDP.

The impulse response functions are normally hump-shapedathere is a small effect initially and the effect grows over time with the maximal impact occurring several quarters after the policy surprise. After the peak impact, the effect of the policy change on the real economy fades away, with the variables returning to their long run steady state values. The hump-shaped impulse response function illustrates that there are lagged effects from a policy surprise. There are a wide variety of statistical models one can use for this exercise but looking across these models, one gets the rule of thumb that the maximal effects of monetary policy changes will hit the economy with a 12-month to 24-month",0.03403414,0.14846575,0.8175001,neutral,-0.11443161,neutral,0.8472267985343933

First, the hump-shaped response means there are no ""cliff effects""aa policy change is not associated with a long period of no effect that is then followed by an abrupt change in the variable. Second, economic variables respond sluggishly to unexpected policy changes and the sluggishness is what generates a lagged response to a policy action. There are many explanations as to why households and businesses respond sluggishly, such as adjustment costs, sticky prices and wages, nominal contracts, habit persistence in consumption, or the fact that there is an option value of waiting when deciding to invest.Given this basic description of how lags are estimated, let me now turn to my questions. First, when did the policy shock occur? In these statistical models,",0.039378457,0.17962088,0.7810007,neutral,-0.14024243,neutral,0.7475084066390991

In short, from the point of view of the model, the FOMC wakes up one morning and surprises markets with a 25-basis point hike.2 While this is a fun exercise to see what happens, it doesn't really capture how monetary policy works in practice. Only rarely do policymakers try to surprise markets, and in fact, we usually specify our policy intentions well ahead of time through the use of forward guidance. As I said earlier, forward guidance is one of the purposes of this speech. Forward guidance is used to signal future policy actions and, when it is credible, financial markets price those expected actions into today's interest rates.

As a result, policy tightening occurs with the announcement of policy tightening, not when the rate change actually happens.As an illustration, look at how the two-year Treasury yield moved between late 2021 and March 2022, a time when the FOMC was talking about lifting the policy target range above zero. I have argued in the past that the two-year Treasury yield is a good proxy for the stance of monetary policy and captures announcement effects.3 The 2-year yield went from 25 basis points in September 2021 to around 200 basis points by the March 2022 FOMC meeting.

This forward guidance effectively shaved off about 6 months from the usual 12- to 24-month lag that one might conjecture would be needed to see the 200 basis points of actual tightening affect the economy.4 That is, forward guidance shortens the lag time between when the policy rate changes and when the effects of actual policy tightening occur.Now let me turn to the second question, whether the size of the shock matters for estimating lags in policy. In the standard linear models used for these exercises, the size of the shock doesn't matter. The size of the shock",0.0768835,0.079604454,0.843512,neutral,-0.002720952,positive,0.5284121632575989

Waller,2023-07-13 10:14:00-04:00,"basically scales the effect proportionately without changing the timing of when past changes affect current values of a variable.What I am going to argue is that the size of the shock may lead to changes in economic behavior that change the coefficients in the statistical models. In less jargony words, the degree of sluggish behavior of economic variables to a policy surprise is not constant but can change with the size and nature of the shock.5There are a lot of reasons to think that ""big shocks travel fast,"" meaning they elicit a change in economic behavior that would not be associated with small shocks.

2023-07-13,Governor Christopher J. Waller,2023-07-13 10:15:00-04:00,"on historical experience will be reliable in estimating lags for such an unusual event. To support this line of reasoning, let me use some examples to illustrate the concept that big shocks travel fast.First, a large area of economic research focuses on the idea of ""rational inattention.""6 The basic idea is that households and firms have a limited amount of attention that they can dedicate to processing information. It is costly and time consuming to constantly adjust behavior and portfolios in response to small changes in prices or interest rates. Consequently, people must decide which data to focus on and how often they look at it. Because households and firms ""rationally ignore"" certain data and only look at them infrequently, their behavior looks sluggish in how they respond to small",0.028901758,0.22248533,0.74861294,neutral,-0.19358358,neutral,0.8535211086273193
2023-07-13,Governor Christopher J. Waller,2023-07-13 10:16:00-04:00,"shocks.But this sluggishness does not apply when big shocks hit. For example, large changes in interest rates will get a lot of attention and have a much faster and dramatic impact on consumption, saving and portfolio allocation. The apparently ""sluggish behavior"" based on small shocks disappears, and households and firms change their behavior much more quickly. Big changes in policy rates will tend to cause more rapid changes in behavior, which implies monetary policy lags will be shorter when changes to the policy rate are large and rapid.As a second example, consider the frequency at which firms change their prices. Data show that firms typically adjust their prices once a year, which is usually interpreted to mean that prices are ""sticky."" However, recent evidence shows that because of the big",0.044590026,0.22763203,0.72777796,neutral,-0.183042,neutral,0.6468541026115417

Waller,2023-07-13 10:17:00-04:00,"inflation shock that occurred over the past two years, prices have changed more frequently as firms tried to keep their relative prices in line with rapidly changing market conditions. This fact has important implications for the Phillips curve model that economists use to link unemployment and inflation. The shift in frequency of price setting will affect the slope (the coefficient), which indicates how sensitive inflation is to a change in unemployment.I addressed this issue in a speech earlier this year.7 Using historical data, where the frequency of price adjustment was about once a year, this had the effect of pinning down the slope of the Phillips curve. The Phillips curve was estimated to be very flat. The implication is that unemployment has to increase a lot to bring inflation down",0.06982548,0.32977527,0.6003992,neutral,-0.2599498,neutral,0.6751578450202942

This steepening implies that monetary policy will affect inflation faster and with less effect on the unemployment rate than would occur if price changes were slower. So once again, the lags between changes in monetary policy and inflation should be shorter than historical experience tells us, and as is reflected in models.What is the implication of this economic research?

Economic activity reportedly grew 2 percent in the first quarter, and based on economic data through early July, the Atlanta Fed's GDP projection suggests growth was a touch higher in the second quarter. Recent Institute for Supply Management surveys suggest some continued slowing in the manufacturing sector, but activity outside that sector is still growing at a solid pace.Turning to the labor market, it has been very tight for a long time and the most recent jobs report showed that employers added 209,000 jobs in June. This number came in a little lower than expected, and it is down noticeably from this time last year.

The ratio of job vacancies to the number of people counted as unemployed has declined on balance so far this year, and the number of people quitting their jobs, which I tend to think of as moving for higher wages, has moved down from its peak last year. However, despite these welcome signs of softening, the labor market is still very robust. Job growth is still well above the pre-pandemic average, the unemployment rate remains quite low, and wage growth continues to be above what would support returning inflation to 2 percent.Yesterday, we received new data on consumer price index (CPI) inflation. After 5 consecutive monthly readings of core inflation of 0.4 percent or above, this rate dropped by half in June, to 0.2 percent.

For example, growth in core loans on banks' books has decelerated since late 2022, as banks tightened lending standards and demand slowed amid lagged effects from monetary policy tightening. The deceleration in core loan balances was especially pronounced in early 2023 even before the Silicon Valley",0.3022147,0.5939496,0.10383568,negative,-0.2917349,positive,0.7131815552711487

Moreover, banks have been able to replace core deposit outflows with large time deposits, Federal Home Loan Bank advances and other sources of funding. These actions are leading to a slowdown in credit growth, but one that is in line with monetary policy tightening.So, what does this mean for monetary policy? With the banking sector sound and resilient, fighting inflation remains my top priority, and I believe we will get there.

From there, I will need to see how the data come in. If inflation does not continue to show progress and there are no suggestions of a significant slowdown in economic activity, then a second 25-basis-point hike should come sooner rather than later, but that decision is for the future.1.

I approached the task with humility. We need to be skeptical about the ability of bank managers or regulators to anticipate all emerging risks.

The beauty of capital is that it doesn't care about the source of the loss. Whatever the vulnerability or the shock, capital is able to help absorb the resulting loss and, if sufficient, allow the bank to keep serving its critical role in the economy. Higher levels of capital also provide incentives to a bank's managers and shareholders to prudently manage the bank's risk, since they bear more of the risk of the bank's activities.Holistic Review of Capital Standards I initiated a review of capital standards as one of my first actions as Vice Chair for Supervision.

We have a set of risk-based requirements that are based on the risk of a bank's activities to its safety and soundness and to the financial system, and a set of non-risk-sensitive backstops, which are simple measures the market and regulators can use to understand and protect against the possibility that the risk-sensitive measures get the risk wrong and result in capital requirements that are too low.

Any single way of measuring bank risk would miss or underplay some aspect of risk, and each of the different approaches tends to measure risks not captured or measured as well by the others. Further, a capital framework with multiple ways of measuring risk is harder for banks to game.Of course, there are also downsides to having multiple approaches to measuring risk in calculating capital requirements.",0.053963907,0.1384744,0.80756164,neutral,-0.0845105,neutral,0.8543045520782471

In sum, I believe that the existing approach to capital requirements is sound. As a result, my proposals build on that foundation. The existing approach includes the risk-based requirements, stress testing, the risk-based capital buffers, and the leverage requirements and buffers. Let me quickly summarize the proposal and then turn to each in more detail.With respect to risk-based requirements, the standards should be updated to better reflect credit, trading, and operational risk. To help promote international comparability, the updates to the standards should be consistent with international standards adopted by the Basel Committee.

The exploratory analysis conducted this year demonstrates the capacity of supervisory stress testing to test for a wider range of risks and the value of doing so. Any changes to the stress test should be complementary to the changes to the risk-based capital framework I mentioned above.With respect to the other capital buffersathe global systemically important bank (G-SIB) surcharge4 and the countercyclical capital buffer (CCyB)5aI am not recommending fundamental",0.24649884,0.008606497,0.7448946,neutral,0.23789234,positive,0.592957079410553

For the G-SIB surcharge, I am recommending that we improve the measurement of systemic indicators under the G-SIB surcharge framework, reduce ""cliff effects,"" and increase the sensitivity of the surcharge to changes in a bank's risk profile.With respect to the enhanced supplementary leverage ratio (eSLR), I am not recommending changes to the calibration at this time. With the revisions in risk-based capital requirements I mentioned above, the eSLR generally would not act as the binding constraint at the holding company level, where Treasury market intermediation occurs. We will carefully monitor Treasury market intermediation, and if problems arise, will consider appropriate policy responses.Basel III Endgame An important aspect of my proposals will be to implement the changes to the risk-based capital requirements, referred to as the Basel III endgame, which are intended to",0.1255892,0.014674834,0.85973597,neutral,0.11091437,neutral,0.8631629943847656

There was a consensus among the Basel jurisdictions that current rules underestimate risks for the largest, most complex banks. The proposed reforms reflect our current understanding of risks and how to best measure those risks. The international agreement to implement these reforms was finalized more than five years ago, in 2017. Implementing these reforms in a timely way is important, and I am pleased we are beginning that process. And lastly, before I walk through the main areas of changes, I'd like to emphasize that any changes would not be fully effective for some years because of the notice and comment rulemaking process and any final rule would provide for an appropriate transition.First, for a firm's lending activities,",0.14554513,0.0163626,0.83809227,neutral,0.12918252,neutral,0.7187939882278442

Currently, large banks use their own internal models to estimate certain types of credit risk. These internal models for credit risk suffer from several deficiencies. Experience suggests that banks tend to underestimate their credit risk because they have a strong incentive to lower their capital requirements. In addition, the data doesn't lend itself to robust modeling and back testing in some cases because defaults are relatively infrequent.

The proposed changes better align market risk capital requirements with market risk exposure and provide supervisors with improved tools. The proposal would continue to permit firms to use internal models to capture the complex dynamics of most market risks but would not rely on banks modeling certain market risks that are too hard to model.

The proposal would approximate a firm's operational risk charge based on the firm's activities, and adjust the charge upward based on a firm's historical operational losses to add risk sensitivity and provide firms with an incentive to mitigate their operational risk.One important question involves the size of institutions that the new risk-based capital rules should apply to, and I will recommend that the",0.113962784,0.020013649,0.86602354,neutral,0.09394914,neutral,0.9055536389350891

A threshold of $100 billion would subject more banks to our most risk-sensitive capital rules compared to the current framework, which applies to firms that are internationally active or have $700 billion or more in assets. This expanded scope is appropriate for two reasons. First, the proposed rules are less burdensome for banks to implement than the current requirements, since they don't require a bank to develop a suite of internal credit risk and operational risk models to calculate regulatory capital. Second, our recent experience shows that even banks of this size can cause stress that spreads to other institutions and threatens financial stability.

The enhancements to the capital rules should improve the resilience of these firms.Importantly, the proposed adjustments would require banks with assets of $100 billion or more to account for unrealized losses and gains in their available-for-sale (AFS) securities when calculating their regulatory capital. This change would improve the transparency of regulatory capital ratios, since it would better reflect banking organizations' actual loss-absorbing capacity.

If the bank had already been required to include those losses in its reported capital, it is less likely that the market and depositors would have reacted the same way. Furthermore, banks that were required to reflect unrealized losses on AFS securities in regulatory capital managed their interest rate risk more carefully, suggesting that the requirement to include gains and losses on AFS securities in regulatory capital leads to stronger risk management as well.These changes would increase capital requirements overall, but I want to emphasize that they would principally raise capital requirements for the largest, most complex banks. We will have additional information when the proposal is published, but for now, let me put the proposed increases in context.

One can think of the proposal's more accurate risk measures as equivalent to requiring the largest banks hold an additional 2 percentage points of capital, or an additional $2 of capital for every $100 of risk-weighted assets. While this increase in requirements could lead to some changes in bank activities, the benefits of making the financial system more resilient to stresses that could otherwise impair growth are greater.That is not to ignore concerns that changes in capital requirements may cause firms to change their behavior and the way that financial services are provided to our economy. We intend to consider comments carefully and any changes would be implemented with an appropriate phase-in.

Conceptually, this shouldn't be the case, as the changes in the risk-based capital requirements affect the way that minimum capital requirements are calculated, and the stress test is used to calculate the buffer.

In addition, stress testing can be used to assess banks' resilience to different kinds of stress in the financial system.

Specifically, I will recommend that the Board propose to adjust the G-SIB surcharge framework to better match a firm's systemic footprint.

This change would more accurately reflect the systemic risk profile of a firm and reduce incentives for a firm to reduce its G-SIB surcharge by temporarily altering its balance sheet at year end through so-called ""window dressing.""6 Second, the proposal would reduce ""cliff effects"" in the G-SIB surcharge by measuring G-SIB surcharges in 10-basis point increments instead of the current 50-basis point increments.7 Third, the proposal would make improvements to the measurement of some systemic indicators to better align them with risk. These changes would ensure that the G-SIB surcharge better reflects the systemic risk of each G-SIB.Some have argued that certain fixed dollar elements of the G-SIB surcharge should be updated for changes in the economy since the surcharge was adopted.

Maintaining the fixed elements of the G-SIB surcharge should help to provide a further incentive for G-SIBs to reduce their systemic footprint, and to promote competitive opportunities for large banks that are not-G-SIBs in order to maintain the diversity of our banking system, while providing further protections against systemically risky events.Continuous Assessment of Capital Needs and the CCyB As part of the holistic review, I have evaluated whether to adjust the CCyB framework. I do not plan to recommend to the Board that we adjust the CCyB framework. The goal of the countercyclical capital buffer is to build buffers in good times to help prepare for bad times.

Conversely, where times of stress would justify lowering capital buffers, we will consider taking accommodating actions as we did in the midst of the COVID-19 crisis.Calibration of the Enhanced Supplementary Leverage Ratio As part of the holistic review, I have also evaluated whether to adjust the enhanced supplementary leverage ratio. While we should continuously improve our risk-based capital requirements to reflect our understanding of risks, experience has shown that there will be times when banks and regulators are unable to accurately measure all risks. That is why regulators have adopted a leverage ratio, which compares the amount of capital held by banks with their total assets. Leverage requirements do not vary based on risk-weighted assets.

Yet problems can sometimes emerge if leverage ratios are the most binding of the capital requirements because then banks may have an incentive to do less low-risk, low-return activity, and to engage in higher-risk, higher-return activities.Some have argued that when banks are close to the eSLR as a binding constraint that it has reduced Treasury market intermediation. The evidence on that is inconclusive. To the extent it matters, the revisions in risk-based capital requirements I discussed today would mean that the eSLR generally would not act as the binding constraint at the holding company level, where Treasury intermediation occurs.

Long-term debt improves the ability of a bank to be resolved upon failure because the long-term debt can be converted to equity and used to absorb losses. Such a measure would reduce losses borne by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation's (FDIC) Deposit Insurance Fund, and provide the FDIC with additional options for restructuring, selling, or winding down a failed bank. I support applying a long-term debt requirement to all institutions with $100 billion or more in assets.

And importantly, more long-term debt at SVB would have reduced the cost to the FDIC of its resolution. All of these factors would have reduced the risk of contagion to other banks.Conclusion The comprehensive set of proposals that I have described here today would significantly strengthen our financial system and prepare it for emerging and unanticipated risks, such as those that manifested themselves in the banking system earlier this year.

Some industry representatives claim that inadequate capital had nothing to do with those bank failures. I disagree. It was an unsuccessful attempt by SVB to raise capital that caused uninsured depositors to look more closely at how the bank was capitalized.Some industry representatives have claimed that SVB's problems were really related to poor management and shortcomings in the Federal Reserve's supervision.

As I discussed in my speech on capital last December, we need to worry, a lot, about nonbank risks to financial stability.8 The answer, however, is not lower capital requirements for banks, but more attention to those nonbank risks. Further, as stress in nonbank financial markets is often transmitted to the banking system, both directly and indirectly, it is critical that banks have enough capital to",0.10768002,0.1807287,0.7115913,neutral,-0.07304868,neutral,0.7979029417037964

That process will be deliberative and open to public participation and implementation of any changes agreed to will take a least several years, which is why it is so important to begin now. Everyone in America depends on a safe and stable financial system. By strengthening capital standards, we are ensuring that businesses have credit to grow and hire workers, and deal with the ups and downs in the economy. Stronger capital standards mean workers can depend on getting their paychecks and families can save and borrow to plan for the future. Our goal is a financial system that works for everyone, and having strong capital rules is essential for that.1.

I will also discuss how recent developments have revealed residual vulnerabilities that we are going to address, and the need to be vigilant for emerging risks.U.S. economic growth slowed significantly last year, and recent indicators suggest that economic activity has continued to expand at a modest pace.

Higher interest rates and slower output growth also appear to be weighing on business fixed investment.The labor market remains very tight. Over the past three months, payroll job gains have been robust. The unemployment rate has moved up but remains low. There are some signs that supply and demand in the labor market are coming into better balance, including higher labor force participation, some easing in nominal wage growth, and declining vacancies. While the jobs-to-workers gap has declined, labor demand still substantially exceeds the supply of available workers.Inflation, however, remains well above our longer-run goal of 2 percent.

The extent of these effects remains uncertain.At our last meeting, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) decided to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 5 to 5-1/4 percent while continuing the process of significantly reducing our securities holdings. We made this decision in light of the distance we have come in tightening policy, the uncertain lags in monetary policy, and the potential headwinds from credit tightening. As noted in the FOMC's Summary of Economic Projections, a strong majority of Committee participants expect that it will be appropriate to raise interest rates two or more times by the end of the year.1When bank stress emerged in March,",0.34693015,0.1458801,0.50718975,neutral,0.20105004,neutral,0.45395535230636597

I will offer three observations about the events.The first observation is that it is very difficult to resist the natural human tendency to fight the last war. In 2008 we saw banks come under stress from outsized credit losses and insufficient liquidity. Such losses appeared possible in the early days of the 2020 crisis, although they ultimately did not materialize. In our stress tests, we have considered severe stress scenarios that produced losses on banks' books, including outsized credit losses. But, of course, SVB's vulnerability came not from credit risk, but from excessive interest rate risk exposure and a business model that was vulnerable in ways its management did not fully appreciate, including a heavy",0.103657246,0.6430236,0.25331914,negative,-0.53936636,neutral,0.6914380192756653
2023-06-29,Chair Jerome H. Powell,2023-06-29 10:09:00-04:00,"reliance on uninsured deposits.These events suggest a need to strengthen our supervision and regulation of institutions of the size of SVB. I look forward to evaluating proposals for such changes and implementing them where appropriate.2 Much will depend on getting the specifics right, and we should bear in mind that there are always tradeoffs in any financial regulation. In addition, the U.S. has benefited from its rich, multi-tiered banking ecosystem, and that diversity should be preserved.The second observation is the value of forthrightly recognizing when a crisis is building and responding decisively. When SVB failed it was clear that a number of standard assumptions, even though they were informed by hard experience, were wrong. Notably, bank runs were no longer a matter of days or weeksathey could now be nearly instantaneous.

Powell,2023-06-29 10:10:00-04:00,"other parts of the government, we were able to act decisively to meet the liquidity needs of the banking system, protect depositors, and limit contagion.The third observation is the value of having the very largest banks be highly resilient. Our regulatory system is much stronger for the substantial additional safeguards we have built around the G-SIBs since the Great Recession. They are subject to capital surcharges, required to be highly liquid, and held to the highest supervisory standards. The events of the past couple of months would have been much more difficult to manage had the largest banks been undercapitalized or illiquid.Conclusion The Great Recession was a watershed moment, demonstrating the terrible consequences a fragile financial system can have on people's lives.

And the ensuing experiences of the pandemic and the past few months did much to validate this approach.The bank runs and failures in 2023, however, were painful reminders that we cannot predict all of the stresses that will inevitably come with time and chance. We therefore must not grow complacent about the financial system's resilience. And building and maintaining that resilience requires collaboration. The system was able to withstand recent shocks because of the efforts by regulators and legislators, including our international counterparts in the globally interconnected financial system.We will take these lessons on board, and we will keep learning, as we must, because the work of building and maintaining a resilient financial system is never done.1.

One justification for pushing these reviews forward has been the recent stress in the banking system.The regulatory framework has evolved substantially since the 2008 financial crisis. The regulatory landscape has become more restrictive, with large increases in capital and liquidity requirements, and other post-crisis reforms to improve bank resiliency. Since that time, the banking landscape has also evolved.

A responsible framework enables regulators to make changes that are informed by open debate and take into account intended and unintended consequences. These two conceptsaadapting to changing conditions, and transparency about regulatory adjustmentsaare intertwined. They inform my view about how bank regulation should evolve and adapt over time. This is particularly relevant now in light of the calls for reform of the regulatory framework, motivated in part by a desire to remediate perceived weaknesses that contributed to recent bank failures.Responsive Regulation and Supervision This year, we have seen the failures of Silicon Valley Bank (SVB), Signature Bank (Signature), and First Republic Bank, and the merger of Credit Suisse",0.106567755,0.055809017,0.83762324,neutral,0.050758738,neutral,0.9060613512992859

These bank failures also highlighted the need for regulators to consider reform efforts to make the financial system stronger and more resilient.Many of the problems we have seen at these banksainterest rate risk, liquidity risk, poor risk managementaare not caused by any evolution in banking.

Requirements for capital, liquidity, resolution plans, stress testing, and supervisory approach are all elements of the regulatory framework.

I'm especially pleased to be a part of today's discussions about how the economy continues to evolve in the post-pandemic environment.1I find that I learn the most valuable information about economic conditions from those who are actually on the ground and working directly in the economy, so I am really looking forward to hearing from today's panelists to learn from their experiences and perspectives.As those of you here today know, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) met last week to discuss the economy and expectations for economic activity.

Over the past several years, as economic activity has continued to normalize, one consistent strength has been the resilience of the labor market. Jobs have grown at a solid pace, wages have increased for many workers, and we've seen continued low unemployment.On the other side of our mandate, price stability, the U.S. economy experienced the most significant inflation in 40 years, reaching a peak of over 9 percent last year. The FOMC has made progress in lowering inflation, but despite the significant tightening of monetary policy, we continue to see unacceptably high levels of inflation.Recent research has argued that pandemic-related supply and",0.86018354,0.09760516,0.042211242,positive,0.76257837,positive,0.9385790228843689

And global and U.S. supply chain disruptions and shipping and logistics challenges drove up prices for a number of goods.2 Many of the supply-side issues have now abated, and the FOMC has rapidly increased the federal funds rate to bring demand into better balance with supply. But while headline inflation has declined substantially, it remains far too high. Therefore, I believe there is more work to do to bring inflation down.I supported the FOMC's decision last week to hold the federal funds rate target range steady and to continue to reduce the Fed's securities holdings; however, I believe that additional policy rate increases will be necessary to bring inflation down to our target over time.

Instead, new business formation again accelerated and now runs about 30 percent above its pre-pandemic trend.3 Often, a tight labor market is associated with elevated rates of new business formation, but the extent of business startups has been highly unusual. Some have speculated that the shift to more remote work has encouraged more experimentation.

From the outside, central banking can look like the work of individual policymakers, parsing the data and making the hard decisions. In truth, it is a team effort of many people, and that has also been true for editing the International Journal of Central Banking (IJCB) and putting together this conference. I have a long list of people to thank who did the lion's share of that work during the year that I have served as managing editor. But first, for those who may not know it, let me review the history of the journal and touch on what this conference will address.In the summer of 2004, the Bank for International Settlements (BIS), the European Central Bank, and the Group of Ten central banks agreed to support the development of a",0.14308116,0.013232528,0.84368634,neutral,0.12984863,neutral,0.6633135676383972

There was no shortage of research on central banking, and, indeed, central bankers themselves did and continue to publish peer-reviewed research in leading journals, not to mention many working papers published by central banks and other outlets. This work was prevalent, but there was a sense that there lacked a place for scholarly research that focused exclusively on central banking and could serve as a forum for the community of central bankers around the world. The creation of the International Journal of Central Banking filled this deficit. The primary objectives of the IJCB are to widely disseminate the best policy-relevant and applied research on central banking and to promote communication among researchers inside and outside central banks.

We have the strong support now of 55 sponsoring institutions, including the CBI and the Bank of Canada, which hosted last year's conference.In 2022, we chose the theme for this year's conference based on events very much on the minds of central bankers: ""Global Supply Shocks, Trade Frictions, and Inflation."" Global and sectoral supply shocks over the past few years have had significant effects on trade, economic activity, and inflation, and they figured prominently in monetary policymaking. The effects of these shocks have varied across different economies, but a common theme is elevated inflation.

Waller,2023-06-16 10:00:00-04:00,"I have been asked to talk about monetary policy and financial stability in today's economic environment.1 The recent stress in the U.S. banking system has brought these two topics, their interlinkages, and the tools we use to achieve our goals to the forefront of central bank policy and public discourse. In short, although financial stability and monetary policy tools are used independently, they are nevertheless interconnected via their respective effects on the macroeconomy. So let me take a few minutes to discuss this topic in more detail.Financial stability is essential for monetary policy in the United States to achieve its congressionally mandated goals of maximum employment and price stability. Importantly, stable financial markets and institutions allow changes in the stance of policy to transmit in a smooth and expected way to the financial conditions that households and businesses face in making spending and production decisions.

Waller,2023-06-16 10:01:00-04:00,"the financial system, on the other hand, hinders economic activities of households and businesses, which impedes the attainment of our dual mandate. This is in large part why the Federal Reserve monitors financial stability risksato help ensure that banks, nonbank financial institutions, and financial markets can continue channeling credit to households and businesses.But this is a two-way street. Financial stability depends on a healthy economy, and all else equal is strengthened by monetary policy actions taken to promote our macroeconomic goals. The U.S. financial system is generally resilient enough to handle large shocks. However, in March, we saw an instance where this wasn't true. A rapid, sizable increase in interest rates resulting from persistently elevated inflation contributed to stresses in the banking system that we needed to address using our financial stability tools.Despite the interconnections between maximum employment, price stability, and financial stability, the tools we use",0.18122905,0.24617538,0.5725956,neutral,-0.06494632,neutral,0.7163475155830383

And, I will argue, that separation is appropriate, as each set of tools is fit to its respective purpose.The set of tools the Federal Reserve uses to address financial stability issues is targeted and surgical. These include bank supervisory and regulatory tools that are used on an ongoing basis to promote the safety and soundness of individual financial firms and build a resilient financial system. There are also tools that provide liquidity to banks and other financial intermediaries in emergencies, such as the discount window or lending facilities created to extend credit more broadly.So far, these financial stability tools have had a good track record of effectively promoting financial stability in the United States. Numerous lending facilities set up in the spring of 2020 helped limit strains that the",0.2152862,0.012228124,0.7724857,neutral,0.20305806,neutral,0.9298843145370483

More recently, when the failure of Silicon Valley Bank led to the loss of deposits at other banks, the discount window and a new facility to help ensure banks have the ability to meet the needs of all their depositors have been effective at containing stresses in the banking system. Importantly, these actions to address financial stability enabled us to continue to pursue our monetary policy objectives during these times.Compared with financial stability tools that address liquidity or other strains in targeted individual institutions or segments of the financial system, monetary policy affects everyone and every part of the economy and would be a blunt and less effective tool to address financial stability problems. That said, in carrying out monetary policy, we do consider how credit conditions and other factors related to financial stability are affecting the economy.

The Fed could tighten policy too much if it ignored such a development.To make this argument more concrete, consider the onset of the pandemic in March 2020. The Federal Open Market Committee held two unscheduled meetings where, recognizing that the coronavirus would weigh on economic activity and pose risks to the economic outlook, it lowered the policy target range down to zero. At the same time, the unprecedented uncertainty about how the macroeconomy would be affected by the pandemic destabilized financial markets, which led the Federal Reserve to put in place several lending facilities to support the system.

Although both types of tools were used simultaneously, they were used to solve different problems.Financial stresses in the banking sector are a factor that my colleagues and I are closely watching as we determine the appropriate stance of monetary policy going forward. While lending conditions imposed by banks have tightened since March, the changes so far are in line with what banks have been doing since the Fed began raising interest rates more than a year ago. That is, it is still not clear that recent strains in the banking sector materially intensified the tightening of lending conditions.Let me end by noting that some have argued that the Fed's tightening of monetary policy was significantly responsible for the failures and stress in the banking system.

It is the job of bank leaders to deal with interest rate risk, and nearly all bank leaders have done exactly that. I do not support altering the stance of monetary policy over worries of ineffectual management at a few banks. We will continue to pursue our monetary policy goals, which ultimately support a healthy financial system. At the same time, we will continue to use our financial stability tools to prevent the buildup of risks in the financial system and, when needed, to address strains that may emerge.1.

It provides households and businesses with the financing they need to participate and thrive in a well-functioning economy. It is difficult to anticipate or prevent shocks, but sound policies can mitigate their impact.

Such spillovers could disrupt the flow of credit and cause outsized declines in employment and economic activity. It is not our role, nor should it be our objective, to influence the allocation of credit within or across sectors of the U.S. economy.Financial and nonfinancial institutions and households are linked through a web of relationships. The economic activities of households and businesses depend on the strength of financial institutions' balance sheets, as households and businesses obtain funding through the financial sector. Similarly, the health of the financial sector hinges on the strength of the balance sheets of households, businesses, and financial institutions, as financial institutions' assets are the liabilities of these sectors.The Federal Reserve monitors and assesses potential vulnerabilities that may develop because of interactions",0.02954984,0.13537186,0.8350783,neutral,-0.10582203,neutral,0.781082272529602

We do that by focusing on the safety and soundness of individual supervised institutions and by looking across the entire financial and nonfinancial system for potential risks and vulnerabilities. These risks and vulnerabilities can include elevated valuation pressures, excessive borrowing by households and businesses, excessive leverage in the financial system, and elevated funding risks. In other words, at the Federal Reserve, we use both microprudential and macroprudential approaches to monitor the health of financial institutions and the financial sector.The recent banking stress events remind us that risks and vulnerabilities in financial markets are continuously changing. That is why the staff at the Federal Reserve is constantly monitoring domestic and foreign financial markets and institutions, as well as the financial condition of households and businesses, with the goal of identifying current and future vulnerabilities.

Conditions in the banking sector have stabilized thanks, in part, to decisive emergency actions taken in March by the Federal Reserve, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, and the Treasury. The Federal Reserve, using existing regulatory and supervisory tools, is working to ensure that banks improve and update their liquidity, commercial real estate, and interest rate risk-management practices.I expect spending and economic growth to remain quite slow over the rest of 2023, due to tight financial conditions, low consumer sentiment, heightened",0.61548805,0.29022655,0.09428537,positive,0.3252615,positive,0.9277321696281433

Inflation has come down substantially since last summer, but it is still too high, and by some measures progress has been decelerating recently, particularly in the core services sector. While it is reasonable to expect that the recent banking stress events will lead banks to tighten credit standards further, the amount of tightening and the magnitude of the effect such tightening might have on the U.S. economy is not yet clear, and this uncertainty complicates economic forecasts.Short-term interest rates are 5 percentage points higher than they were a little over a year ago.

In addition, and perhaps more in focus given the recent events affecting certain areas of the banking sector, higher interest rates could further exacerbate stress at banking organizations, especially those that are highly exposed to longer-duration assets and have a relatively high ratio of uninsured deposits to total deposits.

2023-05-31,Governor Philip N. Jefferson,2023-05-31 10:08:00-04:00,"As I mentioned earlier, conditions in the banking sector have stabilized. Moreover, broader U.S. financial markets and the overwhelming majority of financial institutions have been resilient to the recent stress events.The resilience of the financial system to current salient risks can be appreciated by contrasting it to the 2008 Global Financial Crisis. Leading up to the Global Financial Crisis, housing markets were substantially overvalued, mortgage underwriting standards were weak, and home mortgages were at substantial risk of falling underwater if house prices fell. Yet banks had limited loss-absorbing capacity and were heavily reliant on wholesale short-term funding, and interconnections across the financial system were opaque. When housing markets weakened, opacity contributed to investors' fears, short-term funding pulled away, and excessive leverage led to fire sales as financial institutions experienced losses and major firms failed or were rescued",0.012996228,0.9365959,0.050407782,negative,-0.92359966,negative,0.720563530921936

The economy experienced a deep recession, and unemployment ultimately reached 10 percent.The current resilience of the financial sector points to substantially more limited spillovers from recent events. The failures of Silicon Valley Bank, Signature Bank, and First Republic Bank showed excessive reliance at those institutions on uninsured deposits and excessive exposure to interest rate risk. Even so, the overwhelming majority of banks have strong balance sheets with limited leverage, high levels of loss-absorbing capacity, and healthy liquidity. Moreover, household and business balance sheets are generally strong, and the credit quality of loans is generally much better than on the eve of the Global Financial Crisis. Leverage across key parts of the financial sector, including especially the largest banks and broker-dealers, is much lower than in the mid-2000s.Even so, we remain vigilant to the potential",0.49668273,0.39815915,0.10515812,positive,0.09852359,negative,0.9388592839241028
2023-05-31,Governor Philip N. Jefferson,2023-05-31 10:10:00-04:00,"for vulnerabilities to emerge. Three areas of potential concern have been the focus of our supervisory and regulatory work. First, recent stresses highlighted the importance of effective liquidity and interest rate risk management, including both reliance on uninsured deposits and exposure to duration risk in asset holdings. While the resilience of the financial sector will limit the spillovers from recent events, I expect those strains to lead to a further tightening in credit supply from banks that will weigh on economic activity. Second, it is also important to assess how changes in the financial sector, including expanded use of online banking and shifts in behavior that may be driven by access to social media, may alter the potential speed of deposit flows. Third, the weakness in some sectors of commercial real estate will affect the credit quality",0.14487043,0.44668627,0.40844333,negative,-0.30181584,positive,0.5610184669494629

Changes in work preferences and the increase in remote work is leading to a reassessment of the outlook for office and associated retail properties, and it will take time for the extent of that weakness to become clearer.Ongoing Regulatory Capital Initiatives Later in the afternoon, during the second session of the conference, you will be discussing a few key ongoing regulatory capital initiatives, focusing on the completion of the Basel III reforms. As Vice Chair for Supervision Michael Barr has noted, finalizing the Basel III reforms is a high priority for the Federal Reserve. The revised framework should improve the resilience of the banking system by producing more robust and internationally consistent capital requirements for large firms,",0.61801964,0.016605869,0.36537445,positive,0.6014138,neutral,0.8070646524429321
2023-05-31,Governor Philip N. Jefferson,2023-05-31 10:12:00-04:00,"building on improvements made to the capital framework following the Global Financial Crisis. Importantly, the revised framework is expected to reduce unwarranted variability in capital requirements. By increasing standardization, these reforms aim to increase transparency and public confidence in risk-weighted assets while also reducing complexity.As we speak, the staffs of the U.S. federal banking agencies are diligently working on a Basel III endgame proposal that should be issued for public comment soon. At the same time, the Federal Reserve staff is considering ways to enhance the ability of stress tests to capture a wider range of risks and identify vulnerabilities at the largest banking organizations.Conclusion Based on this brief overview of the issues, this afternoon promises to be invigorating and informative.

As monetary policymakers, we are primarily focused on the cyclical mattersameaning how the pandemic and the measures taken to address it complicated accomplishing our dual-mandate objectives of maximum employment and stable prices. Making the best monetary policy decisions over the business cycle requires distinguishing between temporary effects and lasting, structural changes.Today's agenda includes the employment recovery following the high unemployment during the spring of 2020 leading to the current tight labor market.

I am very much looking forward to the discussion.I also look forward to learning from the perspectives of today's participants from around New England about the issues that will be discussed today. I find it especially helpful to participate in regional discussions to broaden my understanding of economic conditions throughout the country. This local perspective is one of the great advantages of the Federal Reserve System's regional structure, and of the Fed Listens initiative, which complements the Board's efforts to understand national economic conditions.In 2019, the Board launched Fed Listens with a year of listening sessions with the public focused on monetary policy and, specifically, on how the Federal Open Market Committee uses interest rates and other tools to promote a healthy economy.

Through Fed Listens and other engagements with the public, we hear about how Americans are faring in the economy and about how our policy decisions affect individuals, businesses, and communities. So our efforts to enhance our ability to listen have continued and have become what I expect will be, and certainly should be, a permanent feature of the Federal Reserve's decisionmaking.Since the pandemic, and with the onset of high inflation, we have seen shifts in the availability of affordable housing and in the housing market more generally. I'm interested to hear how these impacts are being felt in New England. The availability and affordability of housing are critical for families and for communities seeking to attract new jobs and the workers to fill those new employment opportunities. Distinguishing between the short-term effects of the pandemic and longer-term structural shifts in the economy is crucial in making the near-term policy decisions to",0.1521947,0.030712666,0.81709266,neutral,0.12148203,neutral,0.7400215864181519

Bowman,2023-05-31 10:17:00-04:00,"achieve our dual-mandate goals.In the near term, higher interest rates intended to lower inflation work most directly in the housing market. While we expect lower rents will eventually be reflected in inflation data as new leases make their way into the calculations, the residential real estate market appears to be rebounding, with home prices leveling out recently, which has implications for our fight to lower inflation.The pandemic abruptly changed the lives of most Americans and their families, and it fed a surge of demand for those who sought larger homes. It ushered in a wave of homebuilding and renovation that was a significant contributing factor for inflation and supply chain challenges. Much of that initial inflation has moderated, but it will be important to understand the long-term effect of the pandemic environment on household formation and housing demand going forward.Thank you again, President Collins, for hosting this Fed Listens event and for the opportunity to be part of",0.8374944,0.020605138,0.14190051,positive,0.8168892,positive,0.5839606523513794

I confess I am not an expert on Santa Barbara County's diverse economy, beyond my abiding interest in the excellent wines you produce. But you will hear more about the regional outlook from the other two speakers and so I'll focus my remarks on a broader perspective of the U.S. economy and how the data is shaping my policy views.1 Let me cut to the chaseain my view, data since the last meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) has not provided sufficient clarity as to what we should do with our policy rate at the next meeting.

Between now and then, we need to maintain flexibility on the best decision to take in June.Starting with the economy, activity has slowed from its pace in the latter half of last year. Real gross domestic product (GDP) is estimated to have grown at a modest rate last quarter, and different data available for the current quarter could be interpreted as suggesting growth is slowing or even accelerating a bit. Real GDP grew at an annual rate of 1.1 percent in the first three months of the year. The consensus of private sector forecasts tracked by the Blue Chip survey is for annualized growth of only a tenth of a percent or two above zero this quarter.

Retail sales and industrial production rose in April, though those gains followed two months of declining or flat readings. At the same time, April was the second month non-manufacturing businesses expanded modestly, according to respondents of the Institute for Supply Management survey.Despite this slowing in activity from last year, we have a very tight labor market and high inflation. We also are at a period of higher-than-usual uncertainty about how credit conditions are evolving in response to the recent bank failures and stress among some other mid-size banks. Let me talk about each of these three key issues and then conclude with how I see these factors playing into my June policy decision.A Very Tight Labor",0.11964087,0.72405463,0.15630451,negative,-0.60441375,positive,0.48644348978996277
2023-05-24,Governor Christopher J. Waller,2023-05-24 10:03:00-04:00,"Market The employment report for April showed solid job growth, but previous months were revised downward by a significant amount. The unemployment rate fell slightly to 3.4 percent, reaching its low in recent years, which is the lowest since 1969. The labor force participation rate held steady in April after several months of increases. Average hourly earnings rose at their fastest pace this year, and, over the past 12 months, were up 4.4 percent, slightly higher than the yearly pace in March. These data suggest the labor market is still powering forward.However, there are some other signs that the labor market may be cooling. Temporary-help employment fell for the third straight month and is considerably down from last year.

Furthermore, job vacancies declined by 384,000 in March, and the number of job vacancies for every person counted as looking for a job has declined to 1.6, down from the peak of 2 for every job seeker. This reduction is consistent with a softening in labor demand, but it is still far above the 1-to 1 ratio that was typical before the pandemic. Finally, the rate at which people are quitting jobs, a sign of confidence in the job market, has fallen and is in hailing distance of the level that persisted for the couple of years before the pandemic recession.As I have argued in other speeches, a loosening labor market, to help our fight against inflation, doesn't have to mean a recession or big job losses.2",0.009539497,0.9724865,0.017974043,negative,-0.962947,negative,0.9748780131340027

The latest consumer price index (CPI) report showed that headline inflation fell from 5 percent year over year in March to 4.9 percent in April. But that decline was only due to roundingathe actual decrease was just five one-hundreds of a percentage point, from 4.98 percent to 4.93 percent. Almost no progress.The news on core inflation was similar. Core CPI inflation excludes food and energy and is usually a better guide to the underlying trend for prices.

Likewise, narrower definitions of inflation intended to filter out fluctuations in some prices show little progress in the past year. Six of seven of these alternative measures created by different parts of the Federal Reserve System show inflation running between 4 and more than 5 percent over the past year or so.3Bottom line, I am concerned about the lack of progress in any and all of these measures, and I have a couple specific concerns about some important components of inflation. First, core goods prices, which were among the biggest factors that drove the escalation in inflation the past two years, aren't slowing or retreating as much as we need to",0.029709894,0.8049766,0.16531351,negative,-0.7752667,negative,0.9030748605728149

We're hoping there will be a continued slowdown in goods price increases, but we aren't seeing deflation in this category like we had pre-pandemic. A second concern is rent increases, which accounts for most of a category called housing services and is a sizable component of inflation. Lower rent increases from lease renewals last year are slowly making their way into the inflation data, but most recently, a rebound in the housing market is raising questions about how sustained those lower rent increases will be. While housing prices actually have less of a short-term effect on rents than one might think, this upturn in the housing market, which comes even with significantly higher mortgage rates, has raised questions about whether the benefit from the slowing",0.14368722,0.60096914,0.25534365,negative,-0.45728192,negative,0.7256386876106262
2023-05-24,Governor Christopher J. Waller,2023-05-24 10:08:00-04:00,"in rent increases will last as long as we have been expecting. Lastly, as I think of the service category of inflation, I look to how wages are growing, since labor is a large input into production. Though some measures of wage increases have begun to slow, I am concerned that inflation won't be coming down very much unless average hourly earnings decelerate from the most recent level of 4.4 percent to a pace a lot closer to 3 percent.4On Friday, we will be getting April inflation data based on personal consumption expenditures and then May CPI data on the first day of the FOMC meeting.

Waller,2023-05-24 10:09:00-04:00,"are seeing some easing in inflation pressures.Uncertainty about Credit Conditions Turning to banking conditions, I want to emphasize that overall, the banking system is sound and resilient, with strong capital and liquidity. In response to the recent stress, the Federal Reserve, working with the Treasury Department and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, took decisive action to strengthen confidence in the banking system. Employing financial stability tools in response to liquidity pressures allows us to continue to focus on setting monetary policy to achieve our dual mandate of maximum employment and price stability.Monetary policy works in large part by setting the target range for the federal funds rate, and this rate transmits to market interest rates and affects household and business saving, spending, and investment decisions.

Financial conditions can also tighten from non-monetary policy developments. And there has been a lot of discussion about how the recent banking stresses may tighten credit conditions. If lending does slow, this can obviate the need for at least some monetary policy tightening. It is important to account for this other form of tightening in setting the stance of monetary policy. If not considered appropriately, the Fed could tighten too much and needlessly raise the risk of a recession.I am monitoring how credit conditions may be changing, both interest rates and non-rate conditions, such as the number of new loans,",0.03725084,0.6813354,0.28141376,negative,-0.6440846,negative,0.6959437131881714

Since the bank failures in mid-March, the Fed's survey of bank loan officers in April showed some moderate tightening of lending conditions to firms over the previous three months, with somewhat more tightening for lending to smaller firms. Officers for many of the banks in the survey said they expected lending conditions to continue to tighten further in 2023. Lending conditions had tightened significantly already since 2021, and it is hard to tell whether the actual and expected incremental tightening in standards in this survey was more of the same or related to the banking stress.In addition to the Fed survey, a variety of financial market participants over the past few weeks have also reported that credit tightening is expected to continue.

There are a wide range of estimates trying to map this expected credit tightening into policy rate hikes. As of today, it isn't clear to me what the effect on the economy will be.Implications for Monetary Policy Let me turn to the implications for monetary policy. There is a lot of discussion about the next step for policy. There are three options: hike, skip, or pause. Let me outline reasons why each of these options may be appropriate.One might lean toward hiking by focusing on the economic data and interpreting it to suggest that inflation and economic activity are not consistent with significant and ongoing progress toward the FOMC's 2",0.051370185,0.04465846,0.9039713,neutral,0.006711725,neutral,0.8911371231079102

If one doesn't believe the incoming data will be much better, one could advocate for another 25-basis-point hike as the appropriate action in June.Alternatively, one might view the current and incoming data as supporting a hike in June but believe that caution is warranted because there is a high level of uncertainty about how credit conditions are evolving. Another hike combined with an abrupt and unexpected tightening of credit conditions may push the economy down in a rapid and undesirable manner. This possibility is the downside risk of an additional rate hike in the current environment.

There is a little over a month between the June and July FOMC meetings, and during that time we will learn more about how credit conditions are evolving. Over four months will have passed between the Silicon Valley Bank failure and the July meeting. By then we will have a much clearer idea about credit conditions. If banking conditions do not appear to have tightened excessively, then hiking in July could well be the appropriate policy.Lastly, one might want to pause hikes at the June meeting, meaning that the target range is at its terminal rate, if the current stance of policy is thought to be enough to bring inflation down over time.

Most importantly, though, I want to emphasize the role of due process in the Federal Reserve's bank supervision. We should not be remotely analyzing your bank and downgrading your rating without communication and justification. Due process requires formal engagement between examiners and the bank.

It has continued to be a core principle in strengthening bank oversight since the 2008 financial crisis. Over the years, as regulators refined and improved the regulatory and supervisory framework, the concept of tailoring has evolved.

It also recommends differences in regulatory requirements and supervisory expectations, based on the size and complexity of the bank. It is simply common sense that what works well for the largest global systemically important banks (G-SIBs) is not appropriate for regional and community banks. Our tailored approach applies across many areas, including in the stringency and complexity of capital requirements and for regulatory reporting obligations.As regulators consider the appropriate response to the recent bank failures, a renewed focus on the role of tailoring has emerged.

First, we must seriously consider the feedback from a variety of internal and external viewpoints to identify what went wrong. In my view, one of the most effective steps the Federal Reserve could take would be to engage an independent third party to analyze the events surrounding the failure of these banks, so that we can fully understand what led to the failures. Before making conclusions about appropriate responses going forward to address causal issues, we need accurate, impartial, and thorough information to inform the debate about what specifically may be needed to fix any problems in our supervision and regulatory framework.Second, supervisors must do a better job of focusing on and identifying key issues and risks to ensure they can be promptly remediated.",0.11668388,0.026755318,0.85656077,neutral,0.08992856,neutral,0.8777357339859009

Tailoring distinguishes firms by size, risk, and complexity, and imposes appropriate regulatory requirements in light of these differences.

How do we prioritize these issues for improving risk-based supervision? How do we revise those priorities when underlying economic conditions evolve or banks begin to engage in new activities that present new risks?

While my base case forecast for the U.S. economy is not a recession, I expect spending and GDP growth to remain quite slow over the rest of 2023, due to continued tight financial conditions, low consumer sentiment, and a decline in household savings that had built up after the onset of the pandemic. Furthermore, I acknowledge that there are downside risks, among them the possibility that the degree of bank lending restraint and uncertainty could weigh on economic activity more than I expect.The Labor Market Even as GDP growth has slowed, employment has continued to increase, and the current labor",0.014665798,0.9581108,0.027223447,negative,-0.943445,negative,0.9682260751724243

Employers have added an average of 280,000 jobs a month this year. That's down from the 350,000 a month created in the second half of 2022 but still robust. The tight labor market has boosted wages and other compensation for workers. Wage growth has continued to run ahead of the pace consistent with 2 percent inflation and current trends in productivity growth.

Data on job openings and voluntary quits by workers indicate that labor demand has eased somewhat, and this is reflected also in a modest decline in the growth of average hourly earnings, from a 12-month rate of 5 percent in November to 4.4 percent in April.Inflation Now let me turn to the outlook for inflation.

Cheaper energy and a slowdown in food price increases are good news for lower- and middle-income households that spend a larger share of their income for these items.But outside of energy and food, the progress on inflation remains a challenge. Excluding these prices, which tend to be more volatile than prices of other goods and services, leaves what we call ""core"" inflation, and this measure is a useful guide to discern longer-lasting movements in inflation.

And, finally, inflation in nonhousing services, the largest component of services, has been stubbornly high at around 4.5 percent and shows no signs of significant decline yet.Recent Stress in the Banking Sector Overall, the U.S. banking system is sound and resilient, and I am confident it will be able to continue to play its important role providing credit to households and businesses. Nevertheless, it is reasonable to expect that recent stress events will lead some banks to tighten credit standards further. The evidence is that so far there has been only a modest incremental tightening of lending conditions, which had already tightened considerably over the past year since the Federal Reserve began raising interest rates.

The April survey's increase in the share of banks reporting tightening was similar, though a bit larger, for commercial and industrial lending to smaller firms. At this point, it is hard to tell how much of this tightening was in train already, after continued increases in interest rates, and it is likewise difficult to say how much the stress in midsized banks will ultimately curtail credit in the coming year. Furthermore, there is considerable uncertainty about the magnitude of the impact on household spending and business investment, and this uncertainty complicates economic outlook forecasts.The Insurance",0.023191275,0.9152921,0.061516628,negative,-0.8921008,negative,0.8780266046524048

The insurance industry has performed well through recent stresses. Although the profitability of property and casualty insurance companies in 2022 was reduced by natural catastrophes and inflation, the industry's capital appears strong when considering a range of plausible stress events. For life insurers, the recent increase in interest rates has been a mostly welcome development that has supported higher investment returns but also poses risks, such as early withdrawals by some policyholders. While the life insurance industry's capitalization remains strong, the use of reinsurance merits continued monitoring. With that said, let me turn to monetary policy.Considerations for Monetary Policy So what factors will I consider in the",0.79618233,0.095315695,0.10850199,positive,0.70086664,negative,0.5585845112800598

Over the next few weeks, we will receive a considerable amount of data on economic activity for April and May, including the employment report for May and a report on May CPI inflation. Monetary policy should be forward-looking. It should be conducted so that longer-term inflation expectations are well anchored around our inflation target of 2 percent. Monetary policy should also be data dependent to allow for continuous learning about the underlying structure of the economy as new data arrive. These principles of monetary policymaking are always valuable, especially so when the level of uncertainty is high, as it is now.I am guided by the dual mandate assigned to the Federal Reserve by the U.S. Congress: price stability and maximum",0.07400711,0.028897753,0.8970951,neutral,0.045109354,neutral,0.8264824151992798

On the other hand, GDP has slowed considerably this year, and even though the effect has been muted in the labor market so far, demand clearly has begun to feel the effects of interest rates that are 5 percentage points higher than they were a little over a year ago. History shows that monetary policy works with long and variable lags, and that a year is not a long enough period for demand to feel the full effect of higher interest rates.

I am deeply honored by the trust President Biden and Vice President Harris have shown me with the nomination to be the next Vice Chair of the Board.

First, the title presupposes that U.S. monetary policy is currently on the wrong track. Second, the webpage for this conference advances a puzzling definition of the phrase ""on track."" How so? According to the Hoover webpage, ""A key goal of the conference is to examine how to get back on track and, thereby, how to reduce the inflation rate without slowing down economic growth"" (emphasis added).1 As this audience knows, there are macroeconomic models that permit disinflation with no slowdown in economic growth, but the assumptions underlying these models are very strong.2 It's not clear, at least to me, why such a strict metric would be used to assess real-world monetary policymaking.

Then, I will consider credit conditions in response to the recent bank stress events. Next, I will offer some normative thoughts about strategic monetary policymaking in highly uncertain environments.

The good news is that food and energy prices both fell in March, and total PCE inflation slowed to 4.2 percent from 5 percent in February. Since peaking last June, inflation has declined about 2.75 percentage pointsawith nearly all the step-down explained by falling energy prices and slowing food prices. The bad news is that there has been little progress on core inflation.To understand why, I find it useful to separately analyze three large categories that together make up core PCE: goods excluding food and energy, the red line in figure 2; housing services, the black line; and services excluding housing and energy,",0.026169362,0.9316478,0.042182926,negative,-0.9054784,negative,0.956381618976593

Outside of used motor vehicle prices, which fell unexpectedly in March, disinflation in core goods prices is occurring at a slower pace than expected.

Looking ahead, last quarter's growth in consumer spending seems unsustainable. Indeed, after rising very steeply in January 2023, consumer spending ticked down in February and was flat in March. Moreover, I expect slower consumer spending growth over the remainder of the year in response to tight financial conditions, depressed consumer sentiment, greater uncertainty, and declines in overall household wealth and excess savings.Recent Stress in the Banking Sector The tightening in financial conditions we have seen",0.011462367,0.97321194,0.015325688,negative,-0.96174955,negative,0.9714090824127197

Nevertheless, it is reasonable to expect that recent stress events will lead banks to tighten credit standards further.4 Even though it is too early to tell, my view is that these incremental credit restraints will have a mild retardant effect on economic growth because the recent bank failures were isolated and addressed swiftly by aggressive macro- and micro-prudential policy actions.Nevertheless, I acknowledge that there is significant uncertainty around the amount of tightening of credit conditions in the coming year in response to the bank stress and the magnitude of the effect",0.3588166,0.2591575,0.38202587,neutral,0.099659085,neutral,0.3764648735523224

More simply, the data-generating process for the post-pandemic U.S. macroeconomy is less clear.Due to the proximity of the pandemic and its unprecedented disruptions of economic and social activity, there are currently insufficient post-pandemic data to identify the parameters and stable relationships that characterize the possible new structure of the economy.

First, policymakers should be ready to react to a wide range of economic conditions with respect to inflation, unemployment, economic growth, and financial stability. The unprecedented pandemic shock is a good reminder that under extraordinary circumstances it will be difficult to formulate precise forecasts in real time. Our dual mandate from the Congress is especially helpful here. It provides the foundation for all our policy decisions. Second, policymakers should clearly communicate monetary policy decisions to the public. Our commitment to transparency should be evident to the public, and monetary policy should be conducted in a way that anchors longer-term inflation expectations.

In this sense, I am in favor of a Bayesian approach to information processing.While these principles do not constitute a complete monetary policymaking framework, I think they are useful when thinking about features of such frameworks.Conclusion By way of concluding, I would like to return to the question of whether current monetary policy is ""on track"" but allow for the wider defining lens of ""achieving or doing what is necessary or expected."" The national unemployment rate was 3.6 percent in March 2022 when the current monetary policy tightening cycle began. Today, after 500 basis points of tightening of the policy rate, the national unemployment rate stands at a near-record low of 3.4 percent.

Has the current disinflation been uneven and slower than any of us would like? Yes. But my reading of this evidence is that we are ""doing what is necessary or expected"" of us. Furthermore, monetary policy affects the economy and inflation with long and varied lags, and the full effects of our rapid tightening are still likely ahead of us. We are balancing the directives of the dual mandate given to us by the U.S. Congress.

At our most recent meeting last week, in light of the ongoing unacceptably high inflation, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) increased the target range for the federal funds rate by 25 basis points. With this increase, the FOMC has raised the federal funds rate by 5 percentage points since March of last year. These increases, combined with the runoff of our balance sheet, are having the desired effect of tightening financial conditions. In my view, our policy stance is now restrictive, but whether it is sufficiently restrictive to bring inflation down remains uncertain.

When information is more readily and quickly accessible and shared among shareholders, creditors, customers, and depositors, bank management needs to be attuned to how it communicates, especially when remediating identified weaknesses.The failure of SVB illustrates this dynamic.

The flow of information among these depositorsaand the mechanisms that pushed them to act collectivelyaseem apparent in retrospect, but the closely linked relationships among this group exacerbated the risks involved in SVB's public communication of its remediation strategy.But while the risk of uninsured depositors acting collectively was a significant vulnerability, communications from management caused this group to begin to withdraw their deposits on a massive scale",0.082766704,0.647355,0.2698783,negative,-0.5645883,neutral,0.8136751055717468

This enables supervisors to provide feedback to bank management before these issues escalate and are cited in examination reports and as Matters Requiring Attention (MRAs), Matters Requiring Immediate Attention (MRIAs), or enforcement actions.

As we consider potential changes to improve supervision and regulation, we should start from a baseline understanding of the available tools and determine whether those tools have been utilized and implemented effectively. Before regulators seek new tools, it is necessary to understand the needahow would the use of those new tools address deficiencies in the existing regulatory toolkit?

This fine tuning is a core element of maintaining an effective system, constantly re-evaluating whether our tools are effective and used appropriately.There are a few specific areas where I see a need to revisit our approach, specifically in supervision, regulation, and technology.Supervision Starting with supervision, effective bank supervision requires both transparency in expectations, and an assertive supervisory approach when firms fail to meet these expectations.In the past, I have spoken about the",0.1077989,0.025862824,0.86633825,neutral,0.08193608,neutral,0.8008769154548645

Transparency between a bank and its examiners can be a profoundly effective tool by allowing bankers to air issues early with their examiners. This type of communication promotes understandingaof the bank and its operation by examination staff, and of regulatory expectations by the bank's management and board of directors. Amorphous standards or standards that change without prior notice frustrate this goal.If regulators are clear in our expectations with banks, and banks fail to meet those expectations, regulators are well-positioned to take strong action and demand remediation of supervisory issues.

The low interest rate environment following the 2008 financial crisis shifted the supervisory focus away from interest rate risk to other risks, just as the current rising rate environment required supervisors to return to interest rate and emerging credit risk.10Supervision must also complement regulation.

Before changing rules, we need to take a critical look at actual weaknesses, and acknowledge the strengths that should be preserved.As a threshold matter, today's regulatory system is fundamentally strong.

This framework has materially increased bank capital and liquidity and added a number of other requirements to improve resiliency, including new stress testing and resolution planning requirements.Following the 2008 crisis, the U.S. regulators implemented changes designed to improve the quality and quantity of bank capital. This included the introduction of common equity tier 1 (CET1) as a measure of the highest quality form of regulatory capital, and the capital conservation buffer. Today, large U.S. banks are also subject to additional capital requirements, based on the tiering framework.

Today, there are two: the Liquidity Coverage Ratio, which supports short-term resilience by requiring banks to have liquidity to cover net cash outflows in a 30-day stress period; and the Net Stable Funding",0.22474593,0.012218022,0.7630361,neutral,0.2125279,positive,0.7946900725364685

Many of the issues related to the recent bank failures have been identified in bank management and supervision.

I believe the scientific community has rigorously established that our climate is changing. But my role is not to be a climate policymaker. Consistent with the Fed's mandates, I must focus on financial risks, and the questions I'm exploring today are about whether the financial risks associated with climate change are different enough from other financial stability risks to merit special treatment. But before getting to those questions, I'd like to briefly explain how we think about financial stability at the Federal Reserve.Financial stability is at the core of the Federal Reserve and our mission.

In the aftermath of the 2007-09 financial crisis, Congress assigned the Fed additional responsibilities related to promoting financial stability, and the Board of Governors significantly increased the resources dedicated to that purpose. Events in recent years, including the pandemic, emerging geopolitical risks, and recent stress in the banking sector have only highlighted the important role central banks have in understanding and addressing financial stability risks. The Federal Reserve's goal in financial stability is to help ensure that financial institutions and financial markets remain able to provide critical services to households and businesses so that they can continue to support a well-functioning economy through the business cycle.Much of how we think about and monitor financial stability at the Federal Reserve is",0.17982556,0.01751009,0.80266434,neutral,0.16231547,positive,0.5399079918861389

Economists have studied the role of debt in the macroeconomy dating all the way back to Irving Fisher in the 1930s, and in the past 40 years it has been well established that financial disruptions can reduce the efficiency of credit allocation and have real effects on the broader economy.3 When borrowers' financial conditions deteriorate, lenders tend to charge higher rates on loans. That, in turn, can lead to less overall lending and negatively affect the broader economy.4 And in the wake of the 2007-09 financial crisis, we've learned more about the important roles credit growth and asset price growth play in ""boom-bust"" cycles.5Fundamentally, financial stress emerges when someone is owed something and doesn't get paid back or becomes",0.032444097,0.6818604,0.28569552,negative,-0.64941627,negative,0.7970734238624573

Similarly, if I take out a mortgage from a bank and I can't repay it, the bank could take a loss. And if the bank hasn't built sufficient ability to absorb those losses, it may not be able to pay its depositors back. These dynamics can have knock-on effects on asset prices. For example, when people default on their home mortgage loans, banks foreclose and seek to sell the homes, often at steep discounts. Those foreclosure sales can have contagion effects on nearby house prices.6 When a lot of households and businesses take such losses around the same time, it can have real effects on the economy as consumption and investment spending take",0.014268271,0.8576493,0.12808241,negative,-0.84338105,negative,0.8931736350059509

The same process works when market participants fear they won't be paid back or be able to sell their assets. Those fears themselves can drive instability.The implication is that risks to financial stability have a couple of features. First, the risks must have relatively near-term effects, such that the risk manifesting could result in outstanding contracts being breached. Second, the risks must be material enough to create losses large enough to affect the real economy.These insights about vulnerabilities across the financial system inform how we think about monitoring financial stability at the Federal Reserve. We identify risks and prioritize resources around those that are most threatening to the U.S. financial system.

If you think about it, there is a huge set of shocks that could hit at any given time. Some of those shocks do hit, but most do not. Our approach promotes general resiliency, recognizing that we can't predict, prioritize, and tailor specific policy around each and every shock that could occur.7Instead, we focus on monitoring broad groups of vulnerabilities, such as overvalued assets, liquidity risk in the financial system, and the amount of debt held by households and businesses, including banks. This approach implies that we are somewhat agnostic to the particular sources of shocks that may hit the economy at any point in time.

For example, it is plausible that shocks could stem from things ranging from increasing dependence on computer systems and digital technologies to a shrinking labor force to geopolitical risk. Our focus on fundamental vulnerabilities like asset overvaluation, excessive leverage, and liquidity risk in part reflects our humility about our ability to identify the probabilities of each and every potential shock to our system in real time.Let me provide a tangible example from our capital stress test for the largest banks. We use that stress test to ensure banks have sufficient capital to withstand the types of severe credit-driven recessions we've experienced in the United States since World War II.8 We use a design framework for the hypothetical scenarios",0.06853473,0.030633915,0.90083134,neutral,0.037900817,neutral,0.7160869836807251

What is important is that banks have enough capital to absorb losses associated with those highly adverse conditions. And the losses implied by a scenario like that are huge: last year's scenario resulted in hypothetical losses of more than $600 billion for the largest banks. This resulted in a decline in their aggregate common equity capital ratio from 12.4 percent to 9.7 percent, which is still more than double the minimum requirement.That brings us back to my original question: Are the financial risks stemming from climate change somehow different or more material such that we should give them special treatment?

Before I answer, let me offer some definitions to make sure we're all talking about the same things.Climate-related financial risks are generally separated into two groups: physical risks and transition risks. Physical risks include the potential higher frequency and severity of acute events, such as fires, heatwaves, and hurricanes, as well as slower moving events like rising sea levels. Transition risks refer to those risks associated with an economy and society in transition to one that produces less greenhouse gases. These can owe to government policy changes, changes in consumer preferences, and technology transitions.

The question is whether these risks are unique enough to merit special treatment in our financial stability framework.Let's start with physical risks. Unfortunately, like every year, it is possible we will experience forest fires, hurricanes, and other natural disasters in the coming months. These events, of course, are devastating to local communities. But they are not material enough to pose an outsized risk to the overall U.S. economy.Broadly speaking, physical risks could affect the financial system through two related channels. First, physical risks can have a direct impact on property values. Hurricanes, fires, and rising sea levels can all drive down the values of properties. That in turn could put stress on financial institutions that lend against those properties, which could lead them to curb their lending, and suppress economic growth.

For example, recently researchers have found that heat stressaa climate physical risk that is likely to affect the economyahas been priced into bond spreads and stock returns since around 2013.10 In addition, while it is difficult to isolate the effects of weather events on the broader economy, there is evidence to suggest severe weather events like hurricanes do not likely have an outsized effect on growth rates in countries like the United States.11Over time, it is possible some of these physical risks could",0.086979635,0.07860533,0.834415,neutral,0.008374304,neutral,0.7570635676383972

For example, some worry that rising sea levels could significantly change coastal regions. While the cause may be different, the experience of broad property value declines is not a new one. We have had entire American cities that have experienced significant declines in population and property values over time. Take, for example, Detroit. In 1950, Detroit was the fifth largest city in the United States, but now it isn't even in the top 20, after losing two-thirds of its population. I'm thrilled to see that Detroit has made a comeback in recent years, but the relocation of the automobile industry took a serious toll on the city and its people.

What makes the potential future risk of a population decline in coastal cities different?Second, and a more compelling concern, is the notion that property value declines could occur more-or-less instantaneously and on a large scale when, say, property insurers leave a region en masse. That sort of rapid decline in property values, which serve as collateral on loans, could certainly result in losses for banks and other financial intermediaries. But there is a growing body of literature that suggests economic agents are already adjusting behavior to account for risks associated with climate change.12 That should mitigate the risk of these potential ""Minsky moments.""13 For the sake of argument though, suppose a great repricing does occur; would those losses be big enough to spill over into the",0.046724968,0.6817949,0.2714801,negative,-0.6350699,negative,0.9202150106430054

Each year the Federal Reserve stresses the largest banks against a hypothetical severe macroeconomic scenario. The stress tests don't cover all risks, of course, but that scenario typically assumes broad real estate price declines of more than 25 percent across the United States. In last year's stress test, the largest banks were able to absorb nearly $100 billion in losses on loans collateralized by real estate, in addition to another half a trillion dollars of losses on other positions.14What about transition risks? Transition risks are generally neither near-term nor likely to be material given their slow-moving nature and the ability of economic agents to price transition costs into contracts.

Households and businesses are generally well prepared to adjust to slow-moving and predicable changes. As are banks. For example, if banks know that certain industries will gradually become less profitable or assets pledged as collateral will become stranded, they will account for that in their loan pricing, loan duration, and risk assessments. And, because assets held by banks in the United States reprice in less than five years on average, there is ample time to adjust to all but the most abrupt of transitions.16But what if the transition is disorderly? One argument is that uncertainty associated with a disorderly transition will make it difficult for households and businesses to plan.

But policy development is often disorderly and subject to the uncertainty of changing economic realities. In the United States, we have a long history of sweeping policy changes ranging from revisions to the tax code to things like changes in healthcare coverage and environmental policies. While these policy changes can certainly affect the composition of industries, the connection to broader financial stability is far less clear. And when policies are found to have large and damaging consequences, policymakers always have, and frequently make use of, the option to adjust course to limit those disruptions.There are also concerns that technology development associated with climate change will be disorderly.

The pandemic-related economic shutdown created rapid shifts in demand, which continued through the reopening process and reflected people's wants and needs during that time. For instance, there was a sharp move away from in-person services and toward goods. This was coupled with disruptions to supply, both in global supply chains and the labor force. Russia's invasion of Ukraine last year further restricted access to commodities, and the subsequent surge in energy prices drove a spike in consumer price inflation to a peak in mid-2022, reaching levels not seen since the 1980s.As energy prices have moderated and supply disruptions have eased, inflation has followed suit and started to abate.",0.04290786,0.84961903,0.107473195,negative,-0.8067112,negative,0.7627711892127991

The Fed has a preferred consumer price measure, which is the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index. It covers a broader set of goods and services than the CPI, and its weighting of individual prices can change each month to reflect consumer spending behavior. Last week's data suggest that PCE inflation likely will be somewhat above 4 percent in March, also significantly lower than last June. The big question, however, is whether, and how quickly, inflation will continue its downward path toward our target of 2 percent. Much of the decline so far has been driven by the moderation in energy prices, and there is",0.012560086,0.95405185,0.033388045,negative,-0.9414918,negative,0.9700247049331665

We also look at core inflation, which omits volatile food and energy prices and tends to give a more accurate signal of total inflation's trajectory.

One question is whether timely data can give us a sense of where inflation is going. To this end, I have found several useful sources of data. For instance, to forecast core goods priceswhich drove much of the initial surge in inflationI look at various measures of supply chain disruptions and input prices. Those indicators helped predict the moderation in goods prices that emerged last fall. For automobiles, where shortages of semiconductors held down production and drove up prices for both new and used cars, I looked at wholesale used car prices as a leading indicator of retail prices.

To help forecast this component, I have looked at rent increases on new leases, which slowed sharply over the past six months, as a leading indicator. These data come from sources that might be familiar to you, like Zillow, Apartments.com, and Apartment List. One encouraging development is that last week's CPI data showed a significant slowing in housing services inflation.

This relationship has been challenged in recent years, particularly in terms of trying to explain the large movements in inflation since the pandemic.Labor Markets The labor market poses its own set of questions. To what extent has the labor market recovered from the 2020 downturn, and in what ways will it continue to differ from its pre-pandemic structure? With a range of data to consult, which indicators best capture the state of the jobs market?By many measures, the U.S. labor market is very strong.

A critical component of the labor market's fortitude is that it has extended its benefits to historically disadvantaged groupsthose who have persistently seen gaps with their counterparts in other demographics, especially along racial lines. The African American unemployment rate historically has been about 4 to 5 percentage points above the overall unemployment rate, but that gap was cut in about half in 2019, following years of sustained expansion. After widening during the pandemic, that gap has once again narrowed, this time more quickly, and African American unemployment was at a record low of 5.0 percent in March.Similarly, workers in the lowest-income quartile have seen the strongest wage growth relative to other quartiles over the",0.13245243,0.8375839,0.029963579,negative,-0.7051315,negative,0.48545730113983154

Wage growth has moderated somewhat from the rates reached about a year ago. Indicators of hiring have slowed. Job openings, while still elevated, have declined in recent months. And the quits rate has retraced more than half of its pandemic-era rise, falling from a 3 percent peak in late 2021 to 2.6 percent in February.

Labor force participation also has edged up to 62.5 percent in the most recent data. Prime-age participation (for workers aged 25 to 54) is now back to pre-pandemic levels. In our series of Fed Listens events in 2019, when we talked with a wide range of people and community organizations, we heard that a strong labor market can pull in people from the sidelines who have skills that can be developed if given a chance.

He famously praised the automated teller machine as a beneficial bank innovation, but was skeptical about most other financial innovation.3 As we think about crypto-assets, or other forms of innovation, we need to think carefully about which edge of the sword we are looking at: Will the innovation create new efficiencies, help mitigate risks, increase financial inclusion; or will it create new or exacerbate existing risks?Recently, I gave remarks on crypto-assets,4 discussing how individuals can make their own choices about whether to invest in speculative assets, but",0.090840325,0.032976657,0.87618303,neutral,0.057863668,neutral,0.8497933745384216

As I discussed in my prior remarks on crypto-assets, I think of the crypto ecosystem as consisting of several parts, including the database management protocol used to record trades, commonly referred to as blockchain.

At that point, parties can engage in transactions with the tokenized asset by updating records on the blockchain.Why would a financial institution undertake this process to tokenize an asset? What advantages does blockchain offer relative to traditional approaches to conducting transactions? I do not intend to provide exhaustive answers to those questions here, but I do want to highlight several areas.First, blockchain can offer fast or even near-real time",0.046172373,0.02716849,0.92665917,neutral,0.019003883,neutral,0.9481948614120483

The Federal Reserve's FedNow service, which is set to begin operations in July, does not rely on blockchain; and it will provide safe and efficient instant payment services in real time, around the clock, every day of the year.Another potential advantage of tokenized assets is that they are ""programmable"" and have ""smart contract"" functionality.

Rather than relying on each party to separately carry out its leg of the transaction, smart contracts can effectively combine the two, or more, legs of the transaction into a single unified ""atomic"" act that is executed by the smart contract. This may be an additional robust way to achieve delivery-versus-payment (""DVP"") and payment-versus-payment (""PVP"") functionality, such that one leg of a transaction settles if and only if the other leg settles as well.

Firms have executed foreign-exchange trades using blockchain technology with smart contracts in an attempt to improve efficiencies. Separately, financial institutions have used blockchain to facilitate intraday repo transactions. Parties to these transactions may have more flexibility as to when the transactions settle, which in turn has the potential to create additional capital and liquidity efficiency.

So, what does all this mean for banking? Banks are already testing or using AI in a variety of areas. Banks have started to use AI models to generate personalized product suggestions for their customers, and AI can even generate and send a customized marketing email to that customer based on the model's product recommendations.

AI models are only as good as the data they are trained on. This can raise challenges when AI depends on high volumes and different varieties of data, which can complicate efforts to detect problems or biases in datasets.

Technological innovation has changed this landscape in recent years, as we have seen the emergence of new financial services entrants offering payments services, new platforms designed to increase the speed of payments, clearing, and settlement, and new forms of digital money. Over the past several years, and as a direct result of these developments, we have seen a significant increase in attention on central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) from central banks around the world in addition to a great deal of international and domestic engagement on CBDC.

And of course, discussions of the purpose, design, and potential risks of a U.S. CBDC, and technical research about key design elements, continue here in the United States. While the Federal Reserve plays an important role in these ongoing discussions and technical research, the Fed would not implement a U.S. CBDC without the approval of Congress.In broad terms, a CBDC is simply a new form of digital liability of a central bank.

In my view, the fundamental question is: what problem could a CBDC solve?CBDC and the Payment System One issue being examined is whether a CBDC or even broader forms of digital money could make the payment system more efficient. Do these new technologies present opportunities to increase the speed of payments and/or lower costs and frictions within the payment system?Of course, this question takes place in the context of the payments infrastructure in each jurisdiction, both for domestic payments and for cross-border payments.

We have seen a wide range of motivations for this work, including addressing specific inefficiencies in the payment system, providing a CBDC if cash use were to decline, or promoting broader private-sector innovation for future generations of payments.1Improving the speed of payments, particularly retail payments, can be accomplished without the introduction of a CBDC. In the United States, beginning later this year, the Federal Reserve's FedNowSM Service will enable banks in the United States to offer their customers the ability to send and receive payments in real-time.2Policymakers have also raised other arguments for why a CBDC may be suitable in their home countries.

And still others view CBDCs as necessary to preserve the role of central bank money as a stabilizing force in the payments system and to safeguard monetary sovereignty,4 or to ensure that digital money has a high degree of safety and uniformity to promote innovation and competition.5CBDC and Financial Inclusion Another issue that some have raised is whether innovation in money and payments, including a potential U.S. CBDC, could improve financial inclusion. We can all agree that financial inclusion is an important goal when considering improvements in access to financial services, banking, and the payment system. However, in the United States today, over 95 percent of households have a least one member of the household with a banking relationship holding a checking or savings account.6 Of the remaining",0.2246983,0.01577072,0.75953096,neutral,0.20892759,neutral,0.6600203514099121

I think it is unlikely that this group would find the government somehow more trustworthy than highly regulated banks. Unbanked households are also less likely to own mobile phones or have access to the internet, which would present barriers to CBDC adoption. While there has been important research on these barriers to adoption, including consumer attitudes and technology requirements, policymakers also need to consider whether there are other means to improve financial inclusion, such as alternatives for making the distribution of government benefits more efficient and effective like promoting financial literacy.7CBDC for Implementation of Policy Objectives",0.11960917,0.035060897,0.84532994,neutral,0.08454827,neutral,0.7706505060195923
2023-04-18,Governor Michelle W.

Imagine a scenario in which fiscal spending, in the form of government benefits or payments, could be transferred via CBDC and could include a limited timeframe in which they could be spent before expiring. Enabling this type of limit through a CBDC would stand in stark contrast to the flexibility and freedom embedded in physical currency or bank deposits and could serve to control or even harm consumers and businesses.

A CBDC that permitted this type of control not only has the potential to allow the government to limit certain types of private spending or limit access to banking accounts, it could also threaten the Federal Reserve's independence.The Efficiency and Speed of the Payments System CBDCs are often discussed in the context of providing fast or instant payments for a variety of transactions, whether consumer-to-business or person-to-person transactions. As I previously noted, the introduction of the FedNow Service in the United States and other instant payments platforms globally leads me to ask: What could a CBDC accomplish, if anything, over and above what instant payments platforms alone can accomplish?

Participants in the wholesale financial markets have been considering innovative ways to address these frictions with newer technologies such as distributed ledger technology in which shared information across counterparties could be leveraged to increase speed and reduce back-office costs to reconcile transactions before they settle. In the public debate about CBDC, some have argued that the introduction of a wholesale version of a CBDC could fully unlock the benefits of these newer technologies for these financial market use cases. Similar to the questions noted for a retail level CBDC, policymakers must carefully consider the wholesale use cases, including whether there is added value of a wholesale version of CBDC in supporting new infrastructure to financial transactions over and above existing methods.Cross-Border Activities In the international",0.19141422,0.01609834,0.79248744,neutral,0.17531589,neutral,0.7543602585792542

Many policymakers have discussed whether CBDCs could play a role in streamlining cross-border payments by using new technologies, introducing simplified distribution channels, and creating additional opportunities for cross-jurisdictional collaboration and interoperability. Of course, these opportunities may be limited by the regulatory and legal safeguards in place for payments between countries with different legal structures, including customer identification, customer due diligence, and sanctions screening for compliance with regulations and policies for Bank Secrecy Act/Anti-Money Laundering (BSA/AML). These competing priorities are challenging to reconcile. While cross-border payments are among the slowest and least efficient, they also raise substantial legal and regulatory compliance concerns that would apply equally to CBDCs.International Role of the U.S. Dollar Another consideration is whether a CBDC",0.08422915,0.11699695,0.79877394,neutral,-0.032767802,neutral,0.8195879459381104

A CBDC, or lack of it, may not meaningfully change the existing incentives for people, firms, or countries to conduct business in the dollar. Therefore, maintenance of the dollar as a reserve global currency will require broad policies that foster economic growth, liquid markets, and an unwavering commitment to the rule of law. And we should have an imperative to research and experiment with new technological innovation.

As a result of this trend, many central banks have cited the importance of access to central bank money by the general public as a potential reason to issue a CBDC. For example, Sir Jon Cunliffe of the United Kingdom examined the central role money plays in social and economic stability and concluded that, because private money has been replacing the use of government money over time, at some point ""a retail, general purpose digital currency awill be needed in the U.K.""10 Because the Federal Reserve is committed to ensuring the",0.16773847,0.022214254,0.81004727,neutral,0.14552422,neutral,0.8795848488807678

So, an important issue for us to consider would be whether a CBDC could provide the public with a more attractive alternative to cash in a world that may be shifting away from cash-based payments. In probing this question, we need to also consider the privacy implications, and whether a CBDC would be a better alternative than private-sector solutions.Stablecoins and CBDC Some new private forms of money, often referred to as stablecoins, have emerged mainly to support trading in the crypto-asset ecosystem both as a means of payment and as a store of value.

To the extent stablecoins become widely used in day-to-day payments, these features could raise significant concerns. Of course, issuing a CBDC has been discussed as a potential alternative to stablecoins that could address some of these shortcomings. It is also possible that Congress could pass legislation to strengthen the regulation and oversight of stablecoins to mitigate some of these issues. I will be following developments in Congress closely on this and other digital assets.

While the investigation of CBDC raises many policy questions, for the purposes of today's discussion I will focus on a few key areas that are important from my perspective.Privacy Considerations As we consider these potential opportunities for improvements and innovation, we must also note that the introduction of a CBDC could present significant risks, challenges, and tradeoffs.

As a baseline, we need to think about how to protect the privacy of consumers and businesses, while also establishing an appropriate level of transparency that would deter criminal activity.We must ensure that consumer data privacy protections embedded in today's payment systems continue and are extended into future systems. In thinking about the implications of CBDC and privacy, we must also consider the central role that money plays in our daily lives, and the risk that a CBDC would provide not only a window into, but potentially an impediment to, the freedom Americans enjoy in choosing how money and resources are used and invested.

As with many of these considerations, the purpose and intended function of a CBDC has a major impact on its policy and design considerations.Interoperability and Innovation Relatedly, one possible way to design a CBDC could be to focus on providing a foundational layer on top of which banks and other eligible institutions could build their own technology.

The U.S. banking system is a mature, well-functioning, effective and efficient system. Banks provide consumers access to credit and other banking and payments services. Banks also support important public policies, including reporting on suspicious or criminal activity through their BSA/AML compliance and reporting.More importantly, banks play an essential role in the transmission of monetary policy and supporting a well-functioning economy and financial system.

Another benefit to a bank purchase over de novo, is that operating banks have existing core systems and other third-party relationships that can speed up the time to market for a new bank model. Therefore, a charter strip of a healthy target bank often results in a faster and cheaper approval than a de novo application.While charter strips may provide exit opportunities for the bank's previous management and ownership, these transactions can have an adverse effect on local banking markets.

Nonbank financial entities often operate with many fewer constraints, including a lack of capital requirements, activities restrictions, and a lesser degree of supervision and oversight.

Compressed margins, and the corresponding limits on bank profitability, present significant headwinds to de novo bank formation and returns for initial bank investors. Similarly, the demand for banking services tends to track broader economic conditions, independent from bank regulatory policy.However, policymakers should carefully consider elements of the bank regulatory framework that adversely affect de novo formation. To be clear, many of these regulatory barriers are appropriate. Insured depository institutions benefit from the federal safety net of FDIC deposit insurance, and the ability to access liquidity from the Federal Reserve's discount window.

At the same time, barriers to entry into the banking system should not be so strict as to effectively prevent the formation of new banks. We should support regulatory and supervisory policies that encourage prudent and appropriate de novo bank formation.Organizers of a de novo bank face a number of challenges, and the application process itself can be a significant impediment.

The solution should not be to create roadblocks to bank mergers and acquisitionsawhich would lead to further migration of bank activities to the shadow banking system. Instead, we need to consider how regulatory burdens affect private behavior and have created impediments that discourage de novo bank formation.Efficiency in Regulation and Supervision In the context of de novo banks, efficiency in regulation and supervision can be thought of as an exercise in proportionality. In my mind, this is an extension of the risk-based approaches we use throughout supervision. It is certainly not a ""light-touch"" approach, but rather seeks to strike an appropriate balance based on the size, activities, business model, and risks of an institution.

For example, consider whether requiring an up-front capitalization of a de novo institution in an amount far in excess of standard capital requirements is necessary, or whether in some cases a phased approach that takes into account the early performance of the de novo bank may provide similar risk protection with a lower capital burden.14,15Regulatory obligations fall most heavily on small banks, including both community banks and de novos.

However, it is necessary to note that even if the regulatory message appears to support de novo activity, the regulatory tone in delivering this message matters. Investors and those seeking to organize a new bank notice when regulators encourage de novo formation. But almost more important than the words, the tone of that message must also be accompanied by actions that support, not inhibit, de novo bank formation.

(U.K.)18 The PRA and FCA both play a role in the review and chartering of depository institutions, and have jointly adopted the New Bank Start-up Unit initiative, which provides transparent, single-stop resources about the life cycle of de novo bank formation, including planning, applying, early-stage operation, and eventually moving into a mature, steady state as a viable banking operation.In my view, the approach adopted by the",0.23974389,0.007688302,0.7525678,neutral,0.23205559,neutral,0.8083873391151428

While adopting some would require statutory and regulatory changes, and others to some degree may already be a component of our existing practices, I see value in looking holistically at the lessons we can learn to improve transparency and encourage the formation of new banks.First, the New Bank Start-up Unit focuses on the broader timeline of de novo formation, rather than addressing only isolated elements like the filing of an application or the requirements for early-stage operation. The process of creating a de novo bank starts before an application is filed, and is a multiyear process, ideally ending after a brief period of early operations with the de novo transitioning into a mature,",0.12261975,0.01050666,0.86687356,neutral,0.11211309,neutral,0.7528241276741028

Organizers evaluate their business needs, and whether those needs are best served through the creation of a bank charter. They develop a business plan and raise capital. They develop the infrastructure to support the bank, both in terms of management and personnel, but also technology, policies, and procedures. Addressing the long life cycle of de novo formation, and committing to engage with proposed organizers, can lead to better de novo applications and ultimately, more de novo banks.Second, the legal framework for de novo formation in the U.K. involves multiple regulators, but tasks those regulators with distinct, complementary assessment objectives. The PRA focuses on safety and soundness, and promoting competition between firms, while the FCA focuses on protecting consumers, enhancing the integrity of the U.K. financial system, and promoting competition",0.16936883,0.011529591,0.81910163,neutral,0.15783924,positive,0.5887200832366943

A legal framework that reduces overlapping and redundant evaluations can help facilitate efficiency in the application process and can promote greater consistency.Third, the New Bank Start-up Unit provides resources clarifying not only the requirements that apply to de novo banks, but also espouses a philosophy that emphasizes proportionality in requirements, and a case-by-case assessment of firms. For the PRA and FCA, proportionality extends to the setting of capital requirements, capital management expectations, and the calibration of capital buffers.Finally, the resources provided by the New Bank Start-up Unit emphasize the need for de novo institutions to contemplate and prepare for recovery, resolvability, and a solvent wind-down of operations.

The solution to potential weaknesses in de novo banks need not focus exclusively on increasing regulatory and supervisory requirements, particularly if there are lower cost alternatives like improved transparency, and better preparation for resolvability and solvent wind-down. While higher expectations and more capital can improve the resiliency of a de novo bank, those same expectations can contribute to a decline in the overall number of de novo charters.Closing Thoughts In my view, right-sizing regulatory requirements, improving transparency, and supporting regulatory approaches that support new banks are important tools to promote healthy competition and reduce unintended consequences.

As policymakers consider the regulatory and supervisory framework in the U.S. banking system and consider specific adjustments to address identified shortcomings, we should also take into account the impact of incremental additional regulatory changes not only on de novo bank formation, but also on credit availability, competition, and the financial system.1.

SVB was a specialty bank serving the tech sector. Unlike other banks, where a substantial share of deposits is insured and verifiably safe, more than 90 percent of SVB's deposits were above the $250,000-per-account limit for deposit insurance. Additionally, those deposits were largely from many of the same types of businesses, resulting in additional risk.

Based on what is already in the public record, SVB seems to have done a terrible job managing its risks.A bank run that undermines confidence in other banks is the most fundamental risk to the financial system, and the Fed, serving as the lender of last resort, was created in part to prevent such a development. The job of the lender of last resort is to provide sufficient funds to the banking system so that depositors can be confident they will be able to withdraw their funds on demand. If depositors are confident that they will be able to withdraw their funds, then a bank run will stop or never start in the first place.

On March 12, the Fed created an additional lending tool, with the approval of the Secretary of the Treasury, called the Bank Term Funding Program (BTFP), which accepts U.S. government securities collateral at par value with no haircuts for loans with maturities up to a year.

The Institute for Supply Management's (ISM) survey of purchasing managers indicated that manufacturing contracted in March, and the ISM's survey related to non-manufacturing indicated that activity outside the manufacturing sector decelerated in March to a modest pace.

While still showing strong signs of growth, job creation did cool a bit from the hot readings we got in January and February. And we did get some encouraging news that the labor market is rebalancing. First, the labor participation rate increased for the fourth month in a row, so labor supply is slowly increasing. Second, the report on February job openings showed that job vacancies fell 632,000 to 9.9 million and the vacancy rate declined to 6 percent.

So as the labor market continues to rebalance this should help bring inflation down by reducing wage pressures.Now, let's talk about what these developments mean for inflation. Inflation moderated in the second half of 2022, but that progress more or less stalled toward the end of the year, and inflation remains far above the FOMC's target of 2 percent.

2023-03-31,Governor Christopher J. Waller,2023-03-31 10:01:00-04:00,"disagreeing with me.The Phillips curve, a relationship between price or wage inflation and some measure of economic slack, has been the foundation of monetary policy for decades. A common way to estimate it is to look at output price inflation and the unemployment rate. One theory, or story, is that as aggregate demand increases, labor demand will increase as well. As a result, prices of goods and services will rise and firms will hire more workers, as long as there is some stickiness in nominal wages. Consequently, this story implies that the unemployment rate will fall. So, there is a negative relationship between price inflation and unemployment.Another story, based on the New Keynesian model, is that monopolistically competitive firms set prices for some period of time. Firms may have ""sticky prices"" because of menu costs.",0.037331127,0.64402944,0.31863943,negative,-0.60669833,neutral,0.7439911961555481
2023-03-31,Governor Christopher J. Waller,2023-03-31 10:02:00-04:00,"That is, firms face costs to adjust their prices and so choose to reset their prices only when the benefits outweigh the costs. Because firms are not identical, only a share of firms adjust their prices each period. So, when aggregate demand increases, firms with set prices agree to supply the goods demanded at their current prices. Firms that find it worthwhile to adjust their prices will increase their prices. As a result, inflation will arise from the firms that adjusted their prices. Meanwhile, higher employment will come from the sticky price firms, and, implicitly, higher employment goes along with lower unemployment. Once again, we obtain a negative relationship between output price inflation and unemployment. The slope of this relationship hinges on the fraction of firms adjusting their prices in response to the aggregate demand",0.10991051,0.234303,0.65578645,neutral,-0.12439249,neutral,0.6660582423210144

Put another way, the frequency of price changes determines the slope of the Phillips curve.In both these stories, expectations of future inflation play a critical role. In the sticky nominal wage story, workers will seek to maintain their real wages by setting their wage demands based on what they think future inflation will be. In the New Keynesian model, firms set their output prices based on what they think aggregate price inflation will be in the future, and how often and at what pace they expect to change prices. Regardless of whether you think nominal wages are sticky or output prices are sticky, inflation expectations play a critical role in how unemployment responds to changes in the inflation rate.This explanation is all about the short run.

As a result, in most models of nominal rigidities the long-run Phillips curve is vertical.2What do economic data tell us about this relationship? We all know that if you simply plot inflation against the unemployment rate over the past 50 years, you get a blob. There does not appear to be any statistically significant correlation between the two series. In the 1980s and 1990s, so-called freshwater macroeconomists, who tended to work at universities in the middle of the country, argued the data showed that stories about nominal wage or price stickiness were simply wrong and we should quit talking about Phillips curves of any type. Diehard believers in the Phillips curve, the saltwater economists working on the East and West coasts, argued that",0.027926767,0.604072,0.36800122,negative,-0.57614523,neutral,0.6905087828636169
2023-03-31,Governor Christopher J. Waller,2023-03-31 10:05:00-04:00,"the data blob was the result of unstable inflation expectations. If inflation expectations were not stable, then the Phillips curve would shift around in such a way that you could not observe the true relationship in the data.What would cause inflation expectations to be unstable? Kydland and Prescott (1977) provided an explanation, later popularized by Barro and Gordon (1983), that blamed the central bank. If the central bank's promises to keep inflation low were not credible, then private agents' inflation expectations would be different than what the central bank promised, which in turn would cause the Phillips curve to shift around. As a result, the idea that the central bank had to make credible promises to keep inflation low became a bedrock principle of central banking that holds to this day.Inflation targeting provided a framework",0.05723109,0.17661452,0.7661544,neutral,-0.11938343,negative,0.6034440398216248

With a central bank strongly committed to inflation targeting, promises to keep inflation at 2 percent are credible in large part because the central bank is observed taking action to keep it near 2 percent, regardless of what is happening to the unemployment rate. When these promises are credible, the Phillips curve should be relatively flat.What have we seen in the recent data? Let's consider a Phillips curve based on the price index for personal consumption expenditures, which is the Federal Open Market Committee's (FOMC) preferred measure. As shown in figure 1, the Phillips curve was very flat for the 20-plus years before the pandemic, consistent with the story that the Federal Reserve was",0.07522556,0.072685145,0.85208935,neutral,0.002540417,neutral,0.8427769541740417

As the economy recovered from the pandemic shutdowns, inflation increased each month of the year and was running at more than double the Fed's 2 percent target throughout the latter half of 2021. Meanwhile, unemployment fell quite rapidly in 2021, from 6.3 percent at the start of the year to 3.9 percent in December, which was surprising given the long, slow recoveries after recent recessions. Based on the flatness of the Phillips curve in recent decades, some commentators argued that unemployment would have to rise dramatically to bring inflation back down to 2 percent. Others argued that, based on analysis of the Beveridge curve, inflation could be brought down without a significant",0.041973803,0.9124181,0.04560808,negative,-0.8704443,negative,0.9354124665260315

Waller,2023-03-31 10:08:00-04:00,"rise in unemployment, although this conjecture was not without controversy.4But considering the data for 2021, as shown in figure 2, the Phillips curve suddenly looked relatively steep. That is, the labor market became extremely tight as the U.S. economy emerged from pandemic lockdowns. Figure 3 shows that since January 2022, the Phillips curve is essentially vertical: The unemployment rate has hovered around 3.6 percent, and inflation has varied from 7 percent (in June) to 5.3 percent (in December).The recent experience raises the question: What happened to the Phillips curve that it is acting so differently now than in the pre-pandemic period? Freshwater macroeconomists would once again argue that this difference shows the Phillips curve is a statistical anomaly and should not be used as a foundational element guiding monetary policy.

Waller,2023-03-31 10:09:00-04:00,"profession surrounded by freshwater macroeconomists, I am very sympathetic to this argument.But setting that view aside for now, let's consider the two other possible stories I've mentioned to explain the data. The first story relies on inflation expectations becoming unanchored and causing the short-run Phillips curve to shift around. This theory is illustrated in figure 4. There is a vertical long-run Phillips curve anchored at U*, which is the rate of unemployment that occurs in the absence of price stickiness, and realized inflation is equal to inflation expectations. And there is a downward sloping short-run Phillips curve that shows a tradeoff between inflation and unemployment due to some nominal price or wage stickiness in the economy. The short-run Phillips curve assumes a given level of inflation expectations. If inflation expectations increase, the short-run Phillips curve",0.04445532,0.1555097,0.80003494,neutral,-0.111054376,neutral,0.7378655076026917
2023-03-31,Governor Christopher J. Waller,2023-03-31 10:10:00-04:00,"shifts up. So, if inflation expectations have increased in recent history, we would move from a lower to a higher Phillips curve, as shown by the vertical shift up in the dots. These shifting dots generate what, on the surface, looks like an essentially vertical Phillips curve, thereby matching the 2022 data.The second possible explanation follows from the New Keynesian Phillips curve where there is a sudden increase in the frequency of price changes.5 In that model, the slope of the Phillips curve is determined by the frequency of price changesathe more often prices change, the steeper is the Phillips curve. This dynamic is illustrated in figure 5. An increase in the frequency of price changes steepens the short-run Phillips curve even if inflation expectations are well anchored at 2 percent.

2023-03-31,Governor Christopher J. Waller,2023-03-31 10:11:00-04:00,"the frequency of price changes has increased, we would move from a flatter to a steeper short-run Phillips curve. On the surface, moving from the blue to red dot, it again looks like an essentially vertical Phillips curve, but just as in the first story, the data are showing us points on different Phillips curves.What does this suggest about the relationship between inflation and labor market slack and the implications for monetary policy? The answer depends on data about inflation expectations and the frequency of output price changes. Let's look at each of these factors.Figure 6 reproduces two charts on inflation expectations from the Federal Reserve's March 2023 Monetary Policy Report.6 The charts show that the behavior of inflation expectations depends on the data one uses to measure those expectations.7 The left panel reports survey-based",0.027352476,0.05797122,0.9146763,neutral,-0.030618744,neutral,0.8693291544914246

But inflation expectations over a longer horizon remained within the range of values seen in the years before the pandemic and appear broadly consistent with the FOMC's longer-run 2 percent inflation objective. Similarly, in the right panel, market-based measures of longer-term inflation compensation are also broadly in line with readings seen in the years before the pandemic. So, overall, measures of longer-term inflation expectations have remained contained, while shorter-term expectations had moved up in 2021 and have partially reversed their earlier increases.

2023-03-31,Governor Christopher J. Waller,2023-03-31 10:13:00-04:00,"inflation can be associated with an unanchoring of inflation expectations if we believe price-setting behavior is influenced by changes in shorter-term inflation expectations.Let's now look at the data on the frequency of output price changes in 2021 and 2022. Preliminary work by Montag and Villar Vallenas (2023) uses U.S. Consumer Price Index micro-data to examine about 90,000 individual prices each month and determines if there was a change and, if so, was the change an increase or decrease. Figure 7 summarizes their findings. The monthly price change frequency (the black line) increased from about 10 percent of the sample in 2019 to around 20 percent by the end of 2021 and held around that level in 2022. The increase in price change frequency is primarily driven by firms upwardly adjusting their prices (the red dashed",0.24984102,0.15115392,0.59900504,neutral,0.0986871,neutral,0.6986708045005798

Furthermore, anecdotal evidence I have received from market contacts is consistent with the view that firms were quicker to change prices over 2021-22 than they were in the previous decade. So, hard and soft data suggest that the frequency of price changes is contributing to what looks like a steep Phillips curve in recent years.Other than providing for a fun academic discussion, what does this analysis mean for monetary policy makers? If unanchored inflation expectations were driving what looks like a shifting Phillips curve, this would be extremely problematic for central bankers because it could require dramatic actions by the FOMC to lower inflation expectations to shift the Phillips curve back down. In current circumstances, one would need to believe it is shorter-term expectations that matter for price setters. If this",0.0679576,0.3746203,0.5574221,neutral,-0.30666268,neutral,0.629409909248352

However, I am not sure how much weight to put on this story.The higher-frequency-of-price-changes story is a more encouraging guide for central bankers. A steep Phillips curve means inflation can be brought down quickly with relatively little pain in terms of higher unemployment. Recent data are consistent with this story.To conclude, it may not surprise you all that I like story number two a lot better.

Last June, U.S. inflation hit a peak of 7 percent as measured by the 12-month change in the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) index.In response, the Federal Reserve has been using its monetary policy tools to restore price stability by bringing demand into line with still-constrained supply.

For instance, an eventual retreat in car prices may feed into lower prices for car insurance, repairs, and rentals, reversing some of their increases over the past two years.Another potential source of disinflation is that wage growth has moderated somewhat, even as the labor market remains very strong by most measures.

Second, current labor shortages are spurring increased investment in automation that should boost labor productivity over time.

Over the past 15 years, that literature came to be roughly a quarter of the syllabus in the macroeconomics class that I taught.A particular focus over my career, including in my December NBER paper with Matt Marx and Emmanuel Yimfor, is the importance of smaller financial institutions in lending to small and medium-sized firms.4 Those smaller banks over time have developed relevant expertise in small-business lending",0.13437212,0.014918529,0.8507094,neutral,0.11945359,neutral,0.8684067726135254

Thus, I am attentive to whether recent banking developments will restrain credit to small businesses, which could slow innovation and growth in potential output over time.Data dependence and monetary policy Turning to monetary policy, I have said frequently that my approach to policymaking in uncertain times is to be data dependent. And, like everyone, my own research and experiences shape my views on setting that policy. I was at the Council of Economic Advisers during the euro-area crisis, and my work on emerging economiesaparticularly Russia and some African economiesahas taught me how difficult it can be to forecast in highly uncertain environments.Taking all these lessons into account, I approach all our monetary policy discussions with the same mindset:Of course, it is tempting to",0.08124597,0.09950148,0.81925255,neutral,-0.01825551,neutral,0.6694655418395996

But ultimately, policymaking must be forward-looking, which means relying, at least in part, on forecasts. The challenge is to figure out which models apply. For example, when I began studying banks in the post-Soviet era for my dissertation, I found that the standard models used in normal times and for mature, industrialized economies are less useful in highly uncertain environments.Since my first FOMC meeting last June, my data-dependent, risk-management approach has led me to support the Fed's response of frontloading monetary policy tightening to bring inflation under control.After the swift policy response of the past year, monetary policy is now in restrictive territory. For instance, real interest rates are positive across the yield curve.5Going forward, I am weighing the implications",0.1787363,0.042232115,0.77903163,neutral,0.13650419,neutral,0.8915570974349976

On the other hand, if data show continued strength in the economy and slower disinflation, we may have more work to do.The FOMC has been raising rates in smaller increments as we seek a sufficiently restrictive monetary policy stance to return inflation to 2 percent over time. By taking smaller steps, we can observe economic and financial conditions and consider the cumulative effects of our policy actions.For the econometricians, this approach is similar to the iterative procedure in maximum likelihood estimation, where large early steps are followed by smaller steps as",0.107634224,0.040815413,0.85155034,neutral,0.06681881,positive,0.6077975630760193

What I will lay out as priorities for CRA reform align with the priorities you have heard previously from the Federal Reserve, OCC, and FDIC.First, a successful reform of CRA must advance the core purpose of the statute.

The members of the Board of Governors and the presidents of the 12 Federal Reserve Banks constitute the FOMC. The FOMC gathers for eight regularly scheduled meetings each year to discuss economic and financial conditions and to deliberate on monetary policy. In each meeting, the FOMC establishes a target range for the federal funds rate. Figure 1 shows the upper bound in red and the lower bound in blue of the federal funds target range since 2015. We see the range increasing in 2018 as the job market was strengthening and inflation was moving up toward 2 percent.

In March 2020, when the COVID-19 pandemic hit the economy, the FOMC quickly moved the target range down to near zero to support economic activity.Once monetary policy is set, the Fed implements monetary policy by using its policy tools to ensure that the federal funds rate (FFR) stays within the range. The effective federal fund rate is determined by market forces. It is a volume-weighted median of federal funds rates across all borrowers each day. In figure 1, you can see that the Fed has been able to implement monetary policy in such a way that the effective federal funds rate (EFFR), the black line in the figure, has indeed stayed within the target rate range most of the time.To understand how the Fed's tools work, it is",0.07003066,0.05442762,0.8755417,neutral,0.015603039,neutral,0.8876025080680847
2023-03-27,Governor Philip N. Jefferson,2023-03-27 10:04:00-04:00,"important to understand the federal funds market. It is a market where depository institutions borrow funds overnight from certain financial institutions, including other depository institutions and government-sponsored enterprises. These loans are uncollateralized, and the interest rate or cost of the loans is the federal funds rate, which is determined by the supply and demand for reserve balances that financial institutions hold in their ""checking accounts"" at the Fed.3 The Fed can change the total amount of reserves available to the banking system through open market operations or its lending programs. Since the Fed controls the supply of reserves and the amount that it supplies is independent of the interest rate, the supply of reserves is illustrated as a vertical line in the stylized supply and demand curves shown in figure 2.4 Later,",0.02420137,0.045195922,0.93060267,neutral,-0.020994551,neutral,0.9155223369598389

The top portion of the demand curve is capped by the discount rate that the Fed sets. The middle of the curve is downward sloping, like most demand curves. The higher the interest rate or cost to borrow, the lower the quantity of reserves demanded. The bottom portion is nearly flat because, at some point, banks do not find much benefit from holding additional reserves other than earning the interest on reserve balances (IORB) rate from the Fed. In other words, banks prefer to earn money by making loans to consumers and businesses or purchasing securities only if doing so generates a higher return.

Jefferson,2023-03-27 10:06:00-04:00,"follows, I will go deeper into the top and bottom segments of the demand curve.Implementation Tool 1: Discount Window Rate Sets a Ceiling At the top of the demand curve, we see the discount rate, which is the interest rate the Fed charges when it lends money to banks.5 The discount rate is an administered rate, or a rate set by the Fed, and it is one of the tools the Fed uses to implement monetary policy. It sets a ceiling for the federal funds rate because banks, if they are in good standing and have collateral for the discount window loan, can always borrow overnight funds at the discount rate from the Fed. Therefore, they are not willing to pay a higher rate to borrow funds.In practice, however, banks have demonstrated,",0.04346183,0.028265333,0.9282729,neutral,0.015196497,neutral,0.9343082308769226
2023-03-27,Governor Philip N. Jefferson,2023-03-27 10:07:00-04:00,"in the absence of stress, some reluctance to borrow from the discount window. They are concerned that borrowing from the Fed may indicate that the bank is unable to borrow from other financial institutions, and that it sends a negative signal about their financial condition to the world.6 Such dynamics are referred to as the ""stigma"" associated with the use of the discount window.7 Stigma dampens the discount rate's effectiveness as a day-to-day tool the Fed can use to implement monetary policy. Thus, alternative implementation tools are required. This brings me to the next rate I want to talk to you about, the interest rate on reserve balances.Implementation Tool 2: Interest on Reserve Balances Close to the bottom of the demand curve is the interest on reserve balances rate denoted by IORB",0.03583781,0.3018047,0.6623575,neutral,-0.2659669,negative,0.9211918711662292

This is the interest rate the Fed pays on reserves eligible institutions keep at Federal Reserve Banks.8 This interest rate is the primary tool the Fed uses currently to implement monetary policy.9 In the graph, observe that the federal funds rate is close to this rate. The economic force that keeps these two rates close to each other is called arbitrage, the simultaneous purchase and sale of funds (or goods) to profit from a difference in price. Arbitrage keeps prices of financial instruments with similar payoffs close to each other.10 I will illustrate how arbitrage works with an example that makes it clear why the federal funds rate cannot be much lower nor much higher than the interest on reserve balances rate.Arbitrage Keeps Rates Close to Each Other",0.035553094,0.070997976,0.89344895,neutral,-0.03544488,neutral,0.9127184152603149

Banks will quickly realize that they can borrow funds in the federal funds market at 4 percent and deposit those funds at the Fed and earn the interest on reserve balances rate of 4.5 percent, which means that they can earn a profit of 0.5 percent (the difference between the two rates).11 This riskless investment strategy is called an arbitrage opportunity. As long as this arbitrage opportunity exists, banks will borrow funds in the federal funds market and deposit those funds at the Fed, putting upward pressure on the federal funds rate. This upward pressure will continue until the federal funds rate rises to a level close to the interest on reserves and the",0.08614799,0.06000305,0.85384893,neutral,0.026144937,neutral,0.9169358611106873
2023-03-27,Governor Philip N. Jefferson,2023-03-27 10:10:00-04:00,"arbitrage opportunity no longer exists.A similar logic applies when the federal funds rate is much higher than the interest on reserves.12 If this is the case, banks can make money by withdrawing funds from their ""checking account"" at the Fed and lending that money at the higher federal funds rate. More banks willing to lend money in the federal funds market will put downward pressure on the federal funds rate, causing the federal funds rate to decline toward the interest rate on reserves.Implementation Tool 3: Overnight Reverse Repurchase Agreement So far, I have talked about two of the Fed's administered rates; the discount rate, and the interest on reserve balances rate. Now, I will talk about the third key administered rate, the overnight reverse repurchase agreement rate denoted by ON RRP in",0.043748174,0.31935805,0.63689375,neutral,-0.27560988,negative,0.8839600682258606

Not all institutions that lend money in the federal funds market and who are key players in short-term money markets are eligible to receive interest on reserves. Consider, for example, Federal Home Loan Banks. They were set up in the 1930s to support mortgage lending. Today, they manage about $1.5 trillion in assets. They are major lenders in the federal funds market, but they are ineligible to receive interest on reserves. Therefore, they may have an incentive to lend funds at a much lower rate than the interest rate on reserves rather than earn zero interest on idle cash balances. To ensure that these and other institutions do not charge an interest rate much lower than the interest rate on reserves, the Fed uses an overnight reverse repurchase agreement facility",0.033550486,0.06876551,0.897684,neutral,-0.035215028,neutral,0.9189774394035339

At this facility, institutions agree to buy a Treasury security from the Fed and sell it back the next day. In return, the Fed pays the institution the overnight reverse repurchase rate.14 Even though this transaction seems complicated, it is similar to banks depositing reserves at the Fed and receiving interest on them. This transaction, illustrated on slide 5, is equivalent to financial institutions depositing cash at the Fed and the Fed giving them a Treasury security as collateral, paying them the overnight reverse repurchase rate on the deposit,",0.031138096,0.030619,0.93824285,neutral,0.00051909685,neutral,0.9356266856193542

In figure 3, it is the point where supply and demand intersect. In this figure, notice that the supply curve is off to the right and it intersects the flat part of the demand curve.

Instead, as I mentioned earlier, the key tool the Fed uses to implement monetary policy is the interest rate on reserves balances. In figure 3, you can see that by moving the interest rate on reserves down, the Fed shifts the demand for reserves down and affects the federal funds rate even if the demand curve is flat.17 A similar mechanism follows by moving the rate up. As suggested by the graph, the FOMC is mindful about adjusting its other administered rates in sync with the interest rate on reserve balances.

Now, I will talk about how the Fed shifts the supply of reserves in the system. It does so by buying or selling securities, so-called open market operations. When the Fed purchases securities, it pays for them by depositing cash into the appropriate banks' reserve balance accounts, adding to the overall level of reserves (cash) in the banking system.Before 2008, open market operations were the Fed's primary monetary policy tool because there were limited reserves in the banking system, a so-called scarce-reserves regime. In a scarce-reserves environment, the supply curve intersects the demand curve on the downward-sloping part of the demand curve,",0.037179288,0.06468484,0.8981359,neutral,-0.02750555,neutral,0.9231238961219788

The Fed would inject or drain reserves through open market operations to keep the vertical supply curve at the desired locationawhere it intersects the demand curve at the intended federal funds rate. Since the supply of reserves naturally changesafor example, because of the withdrawal of reserves into physical currencyathe Fed conducted these operations frequently. Today, being in an ample-reserves regime, the Fed operates on a different segment of the demand curve and uses different tools, as illustrated in the right panel of figure 4.Technical Adjustments to the Supply of Reserves: A Case Study Although active management of the supply of reserves is not, by design, a feature of an ample-reserves regime, there are times",0.03190796,0.035717446,0.9323746,neutral,-0.0038094856,neutral,0.9150736331939697

For example, in mid-September 2019, strains in funding markets emerged as quarterly corporate tax payments and the settlement of Treasury securities coincided and resulted in a large amount of cash being drained from short-term interest rate investments. In fact, reserve balances fell more than $100 billion over just two days. Although the drain in reserves associated with seasonal tax payments was expected to put some upward pressure on short-term interest rates, the increases in rates that materialized were exceptionally large by historical standards. One such interest rate is the Secured Overnight Financing Rate, a broad measure of the cost of borrowing cash overnight collateralized by Treasury securities.

Specifically, the Fed conducted repurchase agreement (repo) transactions to provide immediate liquidity to the market and help alleviate the funding strains, ensuring the federal funds rate resumed trading within the target range. In addition, the FOMC judged that the prevailing level of reserve supply at that time may have been a bit too low to be consistent with operating in an ample-reserves regime. Accordingly, in early October 2019, the FOMC directed the Fed to maintain over time reserve balances at least as large as the level that had",0.37956348,0.09087282,0.5295637,neutral,0.28869066,positive,0.6636111736297607

Figure 6 shows the evolution of the Fed's balance sheet, where the holdings of U.S. Treasury securities, agency mortgage-backed securities (MBS), and other securities are recorded as assets and reserve balances are recorded as liabilities. Both series are divided by gross domestic product because the Fed's balance sheet should naturally increase over time with economic growth. We entered the ample-reserves regime in 2008, during the 2007a09 financial crisis, as the Fed sharply increased its total assets. In 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic, there was another sharp increase in total assets. In both instances, the",0.10956626,0.020488529,0.8699452,neutral,0.089077726,neutral,0.9476168155670166

The effect of purchasing securities was to reduce longer-term interest rates to support the economy. The expansion of the Fed's balance sheet is popularly known as quantitative easing (QE). When QE ended, the Fed reinvested any maturing securities it held to maintain the size of the balance sheet. Now, the Fed is fighting inflation by raising its interest rate target range and is in the process of shrinking the Fed's balance sheet, which is referred to as quantitative tightening (QT), by passively stopping the reinvestment in some maturing Treasury securities and agency mortgage-backed securities (MBS).19Summary of Tools I've talked about how the Fed has four tools in its toolbox to implement monetary policy.

In March 2022, the FOMC increased its target range for the federal funds rate, for the first time since the onset of the pandemic. In June 2022, we began the process of significantly reducing the size of our balance sheet, after announcing our plans in May.Monetary policy is transmitted to the rest of the economy by affecting financial market prices, such as long-term interest rates, which in turn affect the decisions of households and businesses. Previously, I discussed how changes in the federal funds target range are transmitted to short-term interest rates, such as the overnight reverse repo rates, through arbitrage relationships.

More specifically, according to the expectations theory of the term structure of interest rates, intermediate- and long-term interest rates are the weighted average of expected future short-term interest rates.20 In addition, monetary policy affects risk premiums. Tighter monetary policy tends to reduce the willingness of investors to bear risk, making them less willing to invest in long-term assets, which means that their return (interest rate) must increase for investors to buy these assets.21Figure 7 illustrates how long-term interest rates, which are widely viewed as important for businesses' and households' economic decisions, move in anticipation of changes in the federal funds rate.

Higher long-term interest rates increase the cost of borrowing money for households and businesses. Therefore, high interest rates raise the incentive to save, which in turn dampens consumer spending on interest rate-sensitive expenditures, like housing and automobiles, and slows businesses' investment in new equipment. The decrease in spending decreases the overall demand for goods and services in the economy, thereby reducing the demand/supply imbalances we have seen, and, consequently, reduce inflationary pressures. As a result, the inflation rate should fall back toward 2 percent, the FOMC's inflation rate target.A key question is how much the tightening of financial conditions",0.019488987,0.9335683,0.046942715,negative,-0.9140793,negative,0.9243840575218201

Chair Powell and other colleagues in the Federal Reserve System have pointed out that monetary policy affects the economy and inflation with long, variable, and highly uncertain lags, and we are still learning about the full effect of our tightening thus far.22Conclusion In conclusion, the Fed has a congressional mandate of maximum employment and price stability.

The Federal Reserve Board announced that it will make additional funding available to eligible depository institutions through a newly created Bank Term Funding Program.2 This program will offer one year loans to institutions that pledge U.S. Treasury securities, agency debt and mortgage-backed securities, and other qualifying assets as collateral.

Innovation has always been a priority for banks of all sizes and business models, from small community banks to the largest global systemically important banks (G-SIBs), and for good reason. Banks in the U.S. have a long history of developing and implementing new technologies. Innovation has the potential to make the banking and payments systems faster and more efficient, to bring new products and services to customers, and even to enhance safety and soundness. Yet, some have criticized the banking regulators for being hostile to innovation, at least when that innovation occurs within the regulated financial system.

Banks of all sizes see new opportunities to develop enhanced and customized products for their customers, introduce faster payments, and improve efficiency.If our goal is a banking system that leverages the many benefits of innovation, regulators need to make deliberate choices about how we regulate and supervise. Further, we need to be aware of and sensitive to the unintended consequences of our regulatory framework.

In exercising supervisory and regulatory authority, the federal banking agencies must be aware of not only the risks to the U.S. financial system, but also the harm that can be caused to U.S. consumers and businesses when we don't achieve sufficient clarity and transparency in our expectations and when our regulations are disproportionately burdensome to the risks they are intended to address.

However, third-party relationships can also increase operational risk, data security and cybersecurity vulnerabilities, and create other compliance issues. And of course, a bank's use of third parties does not diminish its responsibility with respect to the activities conducted by the third-party service provider.I think the principles I mentioned earlier can be particularly relevant when thinking about how regulators can support small bank innovation. Transparency in expectations is important for the smallest banks, who may view innovation as a strategic priority, but may lack the resources of larger peers to engage in innovation and third-party partnerships or cover costs of legal advice to address ambiguous regulatory expectations.

The federal banking agencies also published a guide for community banks on conducting due diligence for financial technology companies.7I think these types of efforts are very important as we introduce new regulations and requirements. Clear guidance and practical implementation tools can reduce the burden of regulation while also promoting compliance.The Evolving Regulatory Response to Innovation Innovation allows banks to become more efficient and better meet customer demands.

Having clear (and public) regulatory expectations not only supports public accountability, but also gives banks greater flexibility to innovate and experiment with new technologies.Across a range of activities, both banks and regulators are working to make innovation accessible to all banks, with clear guidance and additional tools and resources to help small banks. I'll now turn to a few specific examples where regulators have been working to develop transparency and clear expectations.Crypto-asset activities Many bank customers have expressed interest in crypto-assets over the past several years, with some banks exploring how they can meet this customer demand.

The variability of these activities complicates the development of clear regulatory expectations around safety and soundness and risk management, and raises questions about legal permissibility. The lack of clear and timely regulatory guidance creates a real challenge for banks interested in exploring these activities.Crypto-asset activities remain an important focus for the Federal Reserve and other bank regulators. While some banks continue to explore offering crypto-asset-related products and services to their customers, the extreme volatility of these assets creates significant challenges for banks. These assets also vary widely in terms of their structure, the markets for trading, and whether they are backed by any assets.

First, the Board published guidance clarifying that all state member banks should notify their lead supervisory point of contact prior to engaging in crypto-asset-related activities.8 The letter also clarified the broad requirements of a firm's obligations, including the need to analyze the legal permissibility of the activities, and to develop adequate systems, risk management, and controls to conduct these activities in a safe and sound manner and consistent with all applicable laws.More recently, the bank regulators published additional guidance to highlight",0.12053737,0.016925856,0.8625367,neutral,0.103611514,neutral,0.888611376285553

I think these are critical next steps to provide clarity around regulatory expectations.Third-party risk management Third-party relationships can provide smaller banks access to new products, services, and technology. The scope of these partnerships can be quite broad, including fintech companies, partners who use the bank's ""Banking as a Service"" products, cloud service providers, and many others. But third-party partnerships designed to bring innovation into a bank can also create risk-management and due diligence challenges, particularly with respect",0.124665745,0.012608625,0.8627256,neutral,0.11205712,neutral,0.8785184621810913

Small banks may have limited experience and in-house expertise conducting due diligence on third-party partners like fintech companies. And small banks likely have limited leverage in negotiating contracts and informational rights with third-party partners. Small banks may also encounter friction with nonbank partners who fail to understand the bank's ongoing responsibilities to ensure that even outsourced activities are conducted in a safe and sound manner and in compliance with consumer protection laws.The Federal Reserve and other federal banking agencies can play an important role in helping banks continue to innovate through third-party partnerships.

But clearer guidance and regulatory expectations will not fully address these challenges. Guidance alone cannot address the challenges that a small bank faces in conducting due diligence on third parties and the difficulty in negotiating a contract with larger nonbank service providers and partners.ICBA has taken some important first steps in determining if there are opportunities to fill these knowledge gaps by leveraging collective action to help with due diligence.

Another area in need of attention is in assisting small banks achieve similar treatment in their contracts in comparison to larger nonbank service providers and partners.All banks should understand regulatory expectations with respect to due diligence, risk management, and ongoing compliance when engaging in third-party relationships. Banking regulators can support this approach by providing clear expectations and the tools smaller banks may need to help them meet these expectations. For example, in 2021 the Federal Reserve began providing state member banks with supervisory reports on their third-party partners",0.1853101,0.011653474,0.8030364,neutral,0.17365663,neutral,0.5326542854309082

These reports contain information that may provide helpful insight in assessing the performance of bank service providers, depending on the services used and the risk the services pose. As we are considering additional opportunities to provide resources in this space, your feedback and experience would be helpful to understand where we should focus our future efforts.Bank service company oversight Another area that complements third-party risk management is the agencies' regulatory authority over bank service companies.

As you all know, last May, the federal banking agencies issued a notice of proposed rulemaking that would amend the Community Reinvestment Act.

From my perspective, it will be important to consider how the costs imposed by any final rule compare to the benefits of the rule, not just in the aggregate, but for institutions of different sizes and engaged in different banking activities.Climate risk management and regulation. Climate risk-management and regulation efforts include the recent launch of a climate scenario exercise for the largest firms and a climate guidance proposal for a broader range of large firms. The Federal Reserve's role in this space is very limited and generally is confined to ensuring banks operate in a safe and sound manner, relying on appropriate risk management.With respect to climate change risks, it is important to think carefully",0.03183818,0.046691097,0.92147076,neutral,-0.014852919,neutral,0.9074775576591492

Of course, all banks below this threshold, including small banks, would remain subject to robust risk-management expectations, which includes managing all material risks. In many instances, these expectations may require banks to manage a range of related risks, especially from extreme weather and natural disasters.Capital. As you know, the banking agencies are currently engaged in a holistic bank capital standards review and are working to implement the Basel III ""endgame"" reforms. With respect to the Basel III capital reforms, the agencies recently reaffirmed their commitment to implement these standards to strengthen the resilience of the U.S. financial system.

There are significant consequences for firms when applications are not acted on in a timely manner, including increased operational risk, the additional expense associated with running two institutions in parallel over a longer period, employee retention issues, and perceived reputational risk. In my mind, this is an area that we need to improve; delays in the processing of applications are not exclusively an issue for large banks.Small banks are also subject to timing issues when engaged in bank merger transactions.

In some cases, these smaller banks face greater issues in pursuing merger transactions than larger banks that operate in dense urban centers with many bank competitors.

For example, in July 2018, we published an article in the Consumer Compliance Supervision Bulletin that explained our concerns that charging consumers overdraft fees based on APSN can constitute an unfair practice.12At the same time, we recognize that some of this risk is driven by system limitations of the core service providers, which can pose a real challenge to community banks confronting this issue in their own transaction processing operations.

The Federal Reserve has dedicated considerable resources to exploring and understanding these technologies and their potential benefits as well as the risks associated with these innovations.A Few Lessons from the ""Crypto Winter"" In contrast to the potential benefits of these technologies, there is the actual experience of the many people whose hope and enthusiasm for crypto-assets have met with disappointment and sometimes devastating loss.

Experience has shown that crypto-assets can face the same fundamental liquidity and credit risks as traditional assets, and can be highly correlated with other traditional risks, rather than being hedges against such risks.While purveyors of crypto-assets have represented to customers that they are protected through the decentralized nature of the underlying technology, customers are often at a greater risk",0.08639635,0.039327584,0.87427604,neutral,0.047068767,neutral,0.8794041275978088

In addition, we clarified that the banks we supervise seeking to issue stablecoins or dollar tokens would have to show that they have controls in place to do so in a safe and sound manner and that they would need to obtain a non-objection notice from Federal Reserve supervisors before proceeding.On February 23,",0.042258117,0.05897113,0.8987707,neutral,-0.016713012,neutral,0.8858230710029602

As Chair Powell has said, stablecoins are a type of private money, and there is a long and messy history of private money in the United States that shows the need for robust regulation and oversight.14 Any entity issuing money denominated in the U.S. dollar and drawing on the trust of the Federal Reserve needs to be subject to federal prudential regulation and supervision.

Stablecoin issuers represent that their liabilities can be redeemed on demand at par, a dollar for a dollar. In fact, however, the assets backing the liability can fluctuate in value. Even if the assets backing the claim are high quality, they cannot necessarily be immediately monetized, and operational risks are quite high. As we have seen all too often, depositors sometimes want or need their money immediately, especially in times of stress. This mismatch in value and liquidity is the recipe for a classic bank run. Issuers are not supervised by the Fed and lack capital and liquidity as a backstop. The banks we regulate, in contrast, are well protected from bank runs through a robust array of supervisory requirements.Consider the consequences if a stablecoin",0.040419277,0.21866713,0.74091357,neutral,-0.17824785,neutral,0.8133638501167297

We must learn from the past to ensure that we do not allow for new forms of unregulated private money subject to classic forms of run risk, and with the associated spillovers and systemic implications for households, businesses, and the broader economy.Conclusion That gets me back to the central point of my remarks, which is the need to balance innovation with safeguards.

It's a pleasure to be with you today and to be part of this discussion on how central banks can support the effective functioning of financial markets.1Financial stability is essential for a well-functioning economy. A financial system is considered stable when its markets and institutions are resilient and able to function even following a severe shock. The Federal Reserve monitors risks to financial stability and uses its supervisory and regulatory tools to mitigate the risks and consequences of financial instability. During periods of financial system stress, the Federal Reserve can use additional tools, such as lending facilities and open market operations, to directly support the effective functioning of key financial markets and the flow of credit throughout the economy.The onset of the global pandemic in the spring of 2020 was a",0.17822072,0.014793656,0.8069856,neutral,0.16342707,neutral,0.7459951639175415

To address the liquidity strains in Treasury and repo markets, the Fed directly purchased large amounts of Treasury securities and conducted term and overnight repo operations using the FOMC's open market operations authority. To address strains in other markets, with the backing of the U.S. Treasury, the Fed used its 13(3) emergency lending authority to establish a number of facilities to support the flow of credit to households, businesses, and communities.2 The Federal Reserve also took a number of other actions, including easing terms on discount window lending and supervisory and regulatory actions, to encourage banks to lend and act as market intermediaries.3The Fed's actions were effective",0.18407987,0.023163266,0.7927569,neutral,0.1609166,neutral,0.8122947812080383

Significant asset purchases and take-up of the Fed's repo operations were required to restore smooth functioning in Treasury markets because of the liquidity needs of a wide swath of investors. By comparison, many of the 13(3) lending facilities saw relatively limited take-up, but they helped support market functioning and the supply of credit in the targeted markets by offering a backstop and bolstering investor confidence.4The pandemic lending programs that experienced more usage saw a decline in use as market functioning was restored, which is a key benefit of lending programs compared with asset purchases. Moreover, shorter-term loans under these programs were relatively quick to roll off the Fed's balance sheet.

The temporary nature of loans from lending facilities activated only under financial market stress adds to the attractiveness of these tools. Lending programs are most effective as backstops when loans are offered at a penalty rate and are of short duration. When appropriately calibrated, lending programs can help promote market functioning but limit the Federal Reserve's overall footprint in financial markets in the longer term.The pandemic experience illustrated that liquidity strains can sometimes be so severe that targeted purchases of",0.22634177,0.1179528,0.65570545,neutral,0.10838897,neutral,0.5559372901916504

Part of the FOMC's plan to lower inflation is reducing this excess tightness, which has been driving elevated wage growth and contributing to high inflation. The Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey data can be noisy so, at times, there is a tendency to downplay large moves. But then on February 3, the job report for January showed a stunning 517,000 increase in employment and the unemployment rate moved down to a level not seen in over 50 years.2 These data indicated that, instead of loosening, the labor market was tightening.3 A little over a",0.021925801,0.9344331,0.043641035,negative,-0.9125073,negative,0.6845847964286804

By this measure, not only had inflation stopped declining in January, it also slowed a lot less in the second half of last year than previously reported.4 Later that week, data on producer prices and last week's report on personal consumption expenditures (PCE) prices reinforced these two points. Retail sales for January also came in much stronger than expected, suggesting the economy was slowing less than it had appeared just a month earlier, a picture that was confirmed by data on personal spending, which represents almost 70 percent of gross domestic product.

It is possible there may be some bumps on that path, but I assure you, the FOMC's dual mandate objectives will be achieved. Inflation has been elevated for nearly two years due to an excess of aggregate demand relative to supply.

That assessment goes for both overall inflation, and ""core"" inflation, which strips out volatile energy and food prices and is a good guide to future price increases. And this holds for both CPI and PCE measures of inflation. Core CPI inflation over the last three months of 2022 was revised up from 3.1 percent (at an annual rate) to now be 4.3 percent. Similarly, the 2022 fourth quarter PCE inflation data was revised from 2.9 percent to 3.6 percent.

And there are reasons to be optimistic about continued improvement, including a sharp deceleration in rent increases since the middle of last year, which will start to get captured in inflation statistics only in the coming months.But recent data suggest that consumer spending isn't slowing that much, that the labor market continues to run unsustainably hot, and that inflation is not coming down as fast as I had thought.

If job creation drops back down to a level consistent with the downward trajectory seen late last year and CPI inflation pulls back significantly from the January numbers and resumes its downward path, then I would endorse raising the target range for the federal funds rate a couple more times, to a projected terminal rate between 5.1 and 5.4 percent.5 On the other hand, if those data reports continue to come in too hot, the",0.058378465,0.8053833,0.13623817,negative,-0.74700487,negative,0.9625433683395386

Then, I will offer some concluding remarks.Different Ways to Measure Inflation The two primary measures of the price level in the United States are the consumer price index, commonly referred to as the CPI, and the personal consumption expenditures price index, commonly referred to as the PCE price index.",0.04329897,0.057833195,0.89886785,neutral,-0.014534224,neutral,0.8494951128959656
2023-02-27,Governor Philip N. Jefferson,2023-02-27 10:02:00-05:00,"Positive changes in these indexes are recorded as inflation. Each inflation measure has both total (or headline) and core subindexes, which I will talk about later. The CPI and PCE price indexes are constructed in broadly similar ways, but there are important differences between them.1 Both indexes measure inflation using a specific basket of goods and services consumed by households. These baskets are similar but not identical across the two measures. Both measures also weight each item in their basket roughly in accordance with its expenditure share. That is, the more households spend on an item, like rent, the higher the weight it receives in the overall index. The weights are broadly similar across the two indexes, but, again, there are some important differences.Now, let's talk in more detail about",0.055075202,0.042657167,0.90226763,neutral,0.012418035,neutral,0.9242696762084961
2023-02-27,Governor Philip N. Jefferson,2023-02-27 10:03:00-05:00,"the differences between the CPI and the PCE price indexes. First, the PCE price index has a broader scope than the CPI. The CPI is limited to expenditures that households pay out of pocket, while the PCE price index covers a broader set of goods and services as it seeks to cover prices for all consumer expenditures in the national income and product accounts (NIPA). For example, the PCE price index includes prices of the health services provided to households through Medicaid, while the CPI excludes these items.Second, the PCE price index and the CPI use different weighting systems. The PCE price index, which is more comprehensive than the CPI, estimates expenditure shares using the national income and product accounts, while the CPI measures expenditure shares using a separate survey",0.03381294,0.059584387,0.9066027,neutral,-0.025771447,neutral,0.912658154964447
2023-02-27,Governor Philip N. Jefferson,2023-02-27 10:04:00-05:00,"of households, the Consumer Expenditure Survey. This leads to some differences in expenditure weights that can at times be important. For example, the share of medical services is notably higher in the PCE price index (partly because the PCE price index includes more kinds of medical expenditures), and the share of housing services is noticeably smaller (because overall expenditures are larger in the PCE price index). As a result, when health-care services or housing services inflation behave differently than other prices, this can lead to differences in PCE versus CPI inflation.Another difference in the weights is that the PCE price index uses time-varying weights, while the official CPI keeps weights fixed for a year. The PCE price index weights change to reflect changes in the goods consumers buy. For instance,",0.06793078,0.2604335,0.67163575,neutral,-0.1925027,neutral,0.5116273760795593
2023-02-27,Governor Philip N. Jefferson,2023-02-27 10:05:00-05:00,"at the start of the pandemic, the CPI was still giving the same weights to cruise ship and airline fares, even though no one was traveling. The time-varying weights in PCE also account for substitution behavior. Suppose the price of apples goes up and the price of oranges stays the same. Consumers are then likely to substitute apples with oranges. In contrast, the CPI does not capture substitution behavior because the basket of goods consumers purchase is updated only once a year (instead of every month) and reflects expenditure patterns prevailing two years ago. The substitution effects captured by the PCE price index is one reason why PCE inflation (black line) is, almost always, lower than CPI inflation (red line), as you can see in figure 1.As I mentioned earlier,",0.05729748,0.15444538,0.7882571,neutral,-0.0971479,neutral,0.8683661222457886

The core subindex is the total index excluding food and energy prices.2 Food and energy prices are more volatile than other prices, which makes total inflation more volatile.This volatility is evident in figure 2. You can see the black line (total PCE price index) exhibiting more drastic ups and downs than core PCE price index, the red line in the graph, and many of the sharp movements are short lived. In other words, the volatility in the total PCE price index makes it harder to discern trends (longer-lasting movements) from transitory movements.

The FOMC has chosen to target the PCE price index because it is broader and it captures more accurately what households are actually consuming.3 In addition, food and energy account for a significant portion of household budgets, so the Federal Reserve's inflation objective is defined in terms of the total PCE price index, but the Fed monitors the core PCE price index, as well as other inflation indicators, in order to identify evolving inflation trends.4Select Components of Core PCE Inflation Now, I would like to dig a bit deeper into recent inflation trends.

But more recently, food inflation has slowed somewhat, as global food prices have retraced some of their earlier increases, while energy prices have fallen noticeably.

I will now discuss the benefits of price stability and a longer-run 2 percent inflation rate target.Price stability is one of two goals assigned to the Federal Reserve by law, but there is also a broad consensus among economic researchers and policymakers that price stability is a desirable objective.

Choices regarding work, savings, and the expansion of business enterprises are likely to be harder when there is uncertainty about the likely future course of prices. Retirement planning by households and investment decisions by firms are, consequently, put on a sounder footing if there is confidence about the future value of the currency. The avoidance of this uncertainty is also likely to be beneficial for national economic performance. If the prospect of high inflation or uncertainty about future inflation factors heavily into firms' and households' calculations, it is less likely that resources will be allocated to activities that raise the productive potential of the economy, rather than into areas",0.1985801,0.02158053,0.77983934,neutral,0.17699957,neutral,0.6544350981712341

In the labor market, as nominal wages are often set in advance, bouts of unanticipated inflation typically lead to a drop in workers' real wages in the short run, and this is a burden on households in meeting their expenses.7More generally, even anticipated rates of inflation can produce redistributions of income. Such redistributions are also likely to be adverse for members of society who do not have ready access to the kinds of financial instruments that would best protect them against high inflation.The likelihood of wide-ranging distortions due to inflation is enhanced by the fact that the U.S. tax code does not fully take inflation into account.

If the economy were instead to experience deflation accompanied by flat or declining wages, then after a few years the homeowners might find it considerably more difficult to cover their monthly fixed mortgage payments than they had originally anticipated. This increase in the real value of debts due to very low inflation or, worse, outright deflation would also be a burden on all households that have outstanding fixed nominal student loans, auto loans, or credit card debt, as well as businesses that had taken out bank loans or issued bonds.In 2012, the FOMC set a formal inflation",0.041793853,0.69877774,0.2594284,negative,-0.65698385,negative,0.7837346196174622

The FOMC's choice of a 2 percent inflation rate, instead of zero, reflected the judgment that reasonable price stability was desirable while also recognizing the reality that very low inflation can also be economically costly.10 In addition, a zero percent goal would make the longer-run nominal interest rate 2 percentage points lower than would be the case under a 2 percent inflation goal. A zero-inflation environment would consequently restrict the FOMC's scope to lower nominal interest rates when this was necessary for stabilization purposes.

If so, then these reputational costs will undermine the key benefits of well-anchored longer-run inflation expectations discussed above: an increased ability of monetary policy to fight economic downturns without sacrificing price stability.

History is replete with confounding factors that make parsing difficult. These factors include supply shocks, labor market structure, economic conditions at the start of the disinflationary episode, how ""well anchored"" are inflation expectations, and the speed at which a disinflation is carried out. Even so, the authors are thorough in what they do. And while one may quibble with bits and pieces, their argument that policymakers should accept that disinflation is likely to be costly is well reasoned.The authors' second takeaway from history is that state dependencies or nonlinearities are also in play.

2023-02-24,Governor Philip N. Jefferson,2023-02-24 10:03:00-05:00,"a higher initial inflation rate is associated with a lower sacrifice ratio. To explain this finding, they advance an argument based on policy credibility. Specifically, they argue that a high initial inflation rate enhances the plausibility of central banks' willingness to incur the cost of reducing inflation. That strikes me as plausible on its face, but there are other stories that may also apply. In the interest of brevity, let me point out just one. Central bankers are constantly warning of combatting inflationary shocks before those forces become embedded in inflation expectations.2 The Volcker disinflation of 1981a82 resulted in a painful recession. But the reduction in inflation was large. Thus, measured in terms of percentage points of inflation reduction, as is conventionally done, it was not particularly costly.3 A plausible, if partial,",0.23873025,0.11396799,0.6473017,neutral,0.12476226,neutral,0.7051807045936584
2023-02-24,Governor Philip N. Jefferson,2023-02-24 10:04:00-05:00,"explanation for this finding is that the Volcker disinflation was carried out before the inflation associated with the second OPEC oil price shock had become entrenched in inflation expectations and more generally at a time when inflation expectations were fluid.4 This is relevant as my colleagues on the FOMC and I strive to bring down actual inflation promptly in order to preserve the ""well anchored"" longer-term inflation expectations we see in the data. It is also consistent with the authors' argument that swift and relatively painless disinflations of the past were due to early and sharp policy interest rate increases.The authors' third takeaway from history is that easing monetary policy before the disinflation is complete, or easing by too much, is costly.5 My reading of this claim is that while central bankers",0.1276402,0.09297774,0.7793821,neutral,0.034662463,neutral,0.833207905292511

While the authors do not present evidence to support this claim, it is an argument with which policymakers nearly always agree, in principle, but find difficult to execute, in practice. As I'll discuss in a minute, choosing the appropriate stance of monetary policy, in real time, to influence expected future economic conditions is a difficult task in the best of circumstances.

Interestingly, the various measures of slack, and specifications for slack, make little difference. The models do a little better when you allow them to see data from the era of high and volatile inflation in the 1960s and '70s instead of restricting consideration to the Great Moderation period, as empirical tests for structural breaks would surely have suggested.6 Two key and related reasons for this improvement are that inflation expectations in the 1960s and 1970s were more persistent and that the slope of the empirical Phillips curve was steeper than during recent",0.122347385,0.040073875,0.8375787,neutral,0.08227351,neutral,0.908379316329956

In particular, the authors contend, on page 19, that ""the apparent anchoring of long-term [inflation] expectations may reflect in part the FOMC's unanticipated shift toward aggressive rate hikes."" In addition, despite the rapid tightening to date, the authors contend that additional monetary policy tightening is likely to prove necessary to achieve 2 percent inflation by 2025 and is likely to lead to a mild recession.Second, there are the more general takeaways.

This result stands despite the authors having benefited from knowledge of how economic forces played out that would not have been available in real time.

Taken at face value, the model assumes, as all models do, that the past tells policymakers what they need to know. But current inflation dynamics are being driven by some pandemic-specific factors not seen in the historical data. It follows that policymakers need to look at a broader range of factors to understand recent inflation dynamics.Let me illustrate this point by considering three large categories that make up core personal consumption expenditures inflation. These are core goods inflation, housing services inflation, and inflation in core services excluding housing.

In contrast, housing services inflation, the blue line in the chart, picked up appreciably in 2022 after having softened early in the pandemic. Inflation in this sector is also driven by certain pandemic-specific factors. In particular, the surge in work from home led to an abrupt increase in the demand for bigger homes located in smaller metro areas or further from city centers. House prices and rents increased significantly. We have not seen a decline in housing services inflation yet, but recent data on new leases and lease renewals indicate that we soon will.

Inflation for these services, most of which are labor intensive, has remained stubbornly high. An important source of inflation pressures in this category has likely been the shortage of workers, which has pushed up labor costs at rates above those consistent with 2 percent inflation. The inflation outlook for this nonhousing category of core services will likely depend in large part on whether labor demand moves into better balance with labor supply and growth in nominal labor costs.

It is a pleasure to join you, and I appreciate the invitation to speak to you virtually for this inaugural Midwest Cyber Workshop hosted by the Federal Reserve Banks of Chicago, Kansas City, and St. Louis.1Cyberattacks threaten businesses and consumers everywhereanone of us is beyond the reach of those that initiate these attacks. Community banks have been the target of cyber and ransomware attacks, and they frequently name cybersecurity as one of the top risks facing the banking industry. In my conversations with bankers, some note the difficulty in attracting and retaining the staff needed to mitigate cyber risks. While there are no easy solutions in the defense against cyberattacks, close coordination among all of the groups represented at this conference is a good first step.As I consider the Federal Reserve's",0.092352234,0.040742543,0.8669052,neutral,0.05160969,neutral,0.7942097187042236

Our efforts must be focused on both banks and their third-party service providers.In my remarks today, I will briefly discuss four topics. First are the implications of evolving technologies and their impacts on the cyber risk landscape. Second, I will discuss how customer demand for innovation and personalized products has increased reliance on third parties. Third, I will cover the recently effective computer security notification rule, and how that rule can benefit regulators through notification of cyber incidents and banks in monitoring their third-party service providers. And finally, I will briefly address some of the Federal Reserve's recent actions related to cyber risk.Evolving Technologies and Their Associated Risks I'll begin with",0.0751601,0.024328513,0.90051144,neutral,0.050831586,neutral,0.8065751194953918

As the pace of technology innovations continue to accelerate, companies are engaging in business in new ways. New products and services present new risks.Since the COVID-19 pandemic, we have seen greater interest in customer adoption of digital banking products and utilization of remote work tools by bank employees, both of which have created new opportunities for cyberattacks. Some of these risks are best addressed directly by the bank with assistance from law enforcement, if necessary. Other risks may best be addressed by service providers.Ransomware One of these risks is from ransomware, which continues to be an prevalent threat to financial institutions. Reports of these kinds of attacks have increased significantly over the past five years, with the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN)",0.14140835,0.065699495,0.79289216,neutral,0.07570886,neutral,0.6783040761947632

This represents a nearly 200 percent increase over 2020 and coincides with elevated geopolitical risk. Moreover, the frequency of ransomware attacks has escalated due to the emergence of ransomware-as-a-service, enabling easier deployment of these types of attacks. Although ransomware impacts financial institutions of all sizes, it disproportionately impacts smaller banks that may not have sufficient resources to protect against these attacks.2Ransomware is often delivered through phishing emails or through the unauthorized installation of malicious programs onto an organization's systems, known as ""drive-by-downloads."" These tactics take advantage of those with access to a bank's internal systems, whose actions, while perhaps well-intentioned, enable the ransomware cyberattack to occur.

Banks should continue efforts to educate those with systems access about these risks.Ransomware attacks can be mitigated by bank management. By using a robust, formal risk assessment process, bank management can develop a comprehensive action plan to prevent a ransomware attack from occurring, or to reduce the impact on the bank should such an attack occur. Banks that have planned ahead for a ransomware attack will be better positioned to respond when an attack occurs.Use of Internal and External Applications Software and public-facing applications are also potential targets for exploitation, requiring effective",0.08274117,0.045307085,0.8719517,neutral,0.037434086,neutral,0.83030766248703

Hackers constantly seek opportunities to exploit software holes and risks exist even with a bank's best efforts to install the most up-to-date security patches. For example, often when vulnerabilities are identified, providers have not yet provided patches to address these issues, leaving the bank vulnerable to what is referred to as zero-day exploits. Supply chain attacks, like the SolarWinds incident, occur when a bad actor compromises software, or software updates, before the vendor can provide it to customers for installation. While there are some mechanisms to mitigate the risk of these attacks, defenses are limited because organizations rarely control their entire software supply chain.4This is an example of a threat that a bank on its own may not be best equipped to address.",0.025766524,0.49610555,0.4781279,negative,-0.47033903,negative,0.7593024373054504

These relationships position small banks to remain competitive and demonstrate their commitment to serving the needs of their customers and communities. At the same time, greater reliance on third parties could create additional opportunity for cyber criminals. The federal banking agencies recognize the increasing role third parties play in providing banks with a multitude of services including access to new technologies, human capital, delivery channels, products, services, and markets.

Although each of these federal banking agencies had already published separate third-party risk management guidance, the intent of the additional proposed guidance is to create consistency across the regulatory agencies and to consider whether further risks should be considered, given the evolving nature of the industry.5 The banking agencies are currently in the process of considering the comments received on that proposal.A bank's use of third parties does not diminish its responsibility to oversee those activities in a safe and sound manner and in compliance with applicable laws and regulations, including consumer laws. To assist banks in their oversight of third parties in implementing risk management programs, in 2021 the Federal Reserve began providing state member banks with reports relevant to their",0.06923203,0.018125253,0.91264266,neutral,0.05110678,neutral,0.9269665479660034

As a former banker, I see this as a valuable resource; having access to these supervisory reports helps to ensure that banks are receiving the information necessary to most effectively manage exposure to the risks posed by their service providers.In August 2021, the agencies also released a guide for community banks titled ""Conducting Due Diligence on Financial Technology Firms."" This guide was drawn from existing guidance, and, while voluntary, it is intended to be a helpful resource for community banks when performing due diligence on prospective relationships with fintech companies.6The third-party service provider landscape has continued to evolve and expand.

The Bank Service Company Act gives the federal banking agencies significant regulatory authority over outsourced banking services. In a world where third parties are providing far more of these services, it seems to me that these providers should bear more responsibility to ensure the outsourced activities are performed in a safe and sound manner. The computer security notification rule is one example that makes appropriate use of this authority.Computer Security Notification Rule Given the escalating frequency and severity of cyberattacks, the agencies published a final rule in late 2021 establishing computer-security incident notification requirements for banks and, importantly, also for their service providers.

This rule is also a good example of efficient regulation, since bank service providers are often best positioned to identify computer-security incidents.Since May 2022, banks and bank service providers have been required to comply with the computer-security incident notification rule. The Federal Reserve continues to expect banks to report breaches of sensitive customer information consistent with applicable law.7 The new service provider reporting requirement together with the Fed's efforts to improve access to service provider reports should help to streamline small banks' efforts to monitor their technology service providers.The Federal Reserve System Focus on",0.09498921,0.015933491,0.8890773,neutral,0.07905572,neutral,0.9289510250091553

These efforts enable the Federal Reserve to work closely with other regulatory agencies to issue consistent guidance and updated examination procedures on critical areas including IT risk management and cybersecurity.Of course, a critical element of the Fed's focus on cybersecurity risk is the expectation that a bank will continue to develop internal expertise and build upon that expertise over time.

It is a pleasure to be with you and to have the opportunity to share some of my views on banking regulation and supervision. Of course, as you know, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) recently held its first meeting of the year. So, before getting into the substance of my remarks, I'll provide some brief thoughts on the economic outlook and monetary policy.1Monetary Policy Let me begin with the FOMC's effort to lower inflation, which continues to be much too high. Stable prices are necessary for a healthy economy and to support a labor market that works for everyone. As a member of the FOMC, I remain focused on bringing inflation down to our 2 percent goal.Over",0.12791082,0.06412808,0.80796105,neutral,0.063782744,neutral,0.9199137687683105

Bowman,2023-02-13 10:01:00-05:00,"the past year, the Committee has taken forceful actions to address unacceptably high inflation by significantly raising the federal funds rate and reducing our balance sheet holdings of Treasury and agency mortgage-backed securities. At our most recent meeting, we continued on that path by further increasing the target range for the federal funds rate by 25 basis points to 4-1/2 to 4-3/4 percent. I expect that ongoing increases will be appropriate to bring the federal funds rate to a sufficiently restrictive level and that it will need to remain there for some time to restore price stability.The economic outlook and the outlook for inflation continue to be highly uncertain. Global and domestic factors are contributing to heightened uncertainty, and I expect that we will continue to be surprised by economic and geopolitical developments and by",0.8634185,0.07052314,0.066058405,positive,0.7928954,positive,0.9290188550949097

Measures of core services inflation have been persistently elevated, and labor demand exceeds the supply of available workers, which is leading employers to increase wages in an effort to retain and attract workers. The ongoing tightness in the labor market puts upward pressure on inflation, even if some components of inflation moderate due to improvements in supply-side factors. The longer high inflation persists, the more likely it is that households and businesses may come to expect higher inflation in the longer term. Should that be the case, the FOMC's job of lowering inflation would be even more challenging.Given the highly uncertain environment, my views on the future path of monetary policy will continue to be informed by",0.19005896,0.69650126,0.11343973,negative,-0.5064423,negative,0.9041971564292908

I will continue to look for consistent evidence that inflation remains on a downward path when considering further rate increases and at what point we will have achieved a sufficiently restrictive stance for the policy rate.We are still far from achieving price stability, and I expect that it will be necessary to further tighten monetary policy to bring inflation down toward our goal. Doing so will likely lead to subdued growth in economic activity and some softening in labor market conditions. While there are costs and risks to tightening monetary policy to lower inflation, I see the costs and risks of allowing inflation to persist as far greater.

While some of these changes will affect only the largest institutions, many will affect community bankers like you and may impact your work to support your local communities.To be clear, the issues facing the banking industry continue to evolve over time, and the regulatory response to these changes must adapt as well. But as we continue to review and revisit the regulatory framework, I'd like to share a few thoughts about how the Federal Reserve can best fulfill its missions of furthering the safety and soundness of banks and promoting the stability of",0.17183168,0.01497243,0.8131958,neutral,0.15685925,neutral,0.8802118301391602

Specifically, I will discuss three topics that are more interconnected than they may appear: (1) Federal Reserve independence, (2) predictability in applications, and (3) tailoring of regulations and supervision.Federal Reserve Independence Most often, the independence of the Federal Reserve is discussed in terms of independence in the setting of monetary policy. While the value of independent decision making in monetary policy is vital, and research shows that it leads to better policy outcomes in the long run, it is also important to emphasize the value of independence in banking supervision and regulation.You may have seen Chair Powell's recent speech on this topic, in which he noted that independence in our bank regulatory function helps to ensure that our decisions are driven primarily by the goals of promoting a safe and sound financial",0.12992878,0.015219002,0.8548522,neutral,0.11470978,neutral,0.8785663843154907

The Federal Reserve's independence in bank regulation also provides stability and consistency to regulated institutions. I am not suggesting that bank regulation remain static in the face of change. To the contrary, the Federal Reserve's regulatory approach must be capable of addressing and adapting to new activities and new risks but also must be constantly directed towards furthering our statutory objectives.Of course, this independence in bank regulation must be accompanied by accountability, to both Congress and the American public.Existing law provides a number of mechanisms to ensure this accountability to Congress. First, members of the Board of Governors are appointed by the President, subject to the",0.060476147,0.018963082,0.9205608,neutral,0.041513063,neutral,0.8500266075134277

Second, the Board also regularly communicates with Congress, both through in-person testimony to relevant banking and financial services committees and by providing regular reports on key areas within the Federal Reserve's areas of responsibility, including semiannual reports on banking applications activity, supervision and regulation, cybersecurity and financial system resilience, and financial stability. This regular cadence of testimony and public reporting provides visibility into the inner working of the Federal Reserve, not just for Congress, but also for the public.Beyond these measures though, accountability also means having transparent policies and procedures and conducting supervision in a way that is predictable and fair. Transparency builds legitimacy and helps demonstrate that the Fed is executing its responsibilities in a fair way for all regulated institutions.

2023-02-13,Governor Michelle W. Bowman,2023-02-13 10:08:00-05:00,"looking to improve is the publication of clear, appropriate guidance, especially for community banks. I think there are examples where we have done a pretty good job, for instance providing tools to help community banks estimate their losses under the Current Expected Credit Loss, or CECL, accounting standard. We owe this duty of transparency to all regulated institutions. For example, I expect the Board will soon publish the supervision criteria implemented by the Large Institution Supervision Coordinating Committeeathe LISCC manual. Banks should have some assurance that they are being held to the same standards as their peers over time. While publication of the manual may be only a modest improvement in transparency, I think it will be an important step.Transparency helps us not only with accountability, but also with building legitimacy and public trust.

We hold banks of all sizes to high standards, commensurate with their size and risk, and being transparent does not dilute the rigor of our regulatory standards. Transparency helps ensure that banks are aware of these standards and expectations so that they can work more effectively and efficiently to meet them.Perhaps most importantly, though, we must implement the laws that Congress has passed as they are written and not stretch that authority to venture into other areas of policymaking.For example, consider the distinction between (1) making sure institutions are managing all of their material risks and (2) instructing banks to make certain credit allocation decisions, that is, telling banks to make or not make loans to certain industries.

But it is equally clear that the second objectiveainfluencing a bank to make certain credit allocation decisionsais not the role of a banking regulator. If you look across the regulated banking sectors, you will find that each bank makes different credit decisions, reacting not only to market demand and economic conditions, but also implementing the bank's strategy. And to be clear, I share the widely held view that the appropriate role of the Federal Reserve is not to make credit allocation decisions for banks.The Fed's role as a banking supervisor is not to replace a bank's management and board of directors in adopting a banking strategy and risk appetite.

This can be a difficult balance to strike but it is something I believe we must always bear in mind whenever the Fed uses or proposes using its regulatory or supervisory tools. Banking regulation and supervision should not be the place to implement new policies that are not mandated by Congress.In the past, I have shared my views about the Fed's rulemaking agenda, which remain the same today. I continue to support changes based on our experience applying existing rules or prompted by new and emerging issues.

And of course, any changes should be to further our regulatory responsibilities as mandated by Congress.I'll turn now to a few examples of ""how"" the Federal Reserve should regulate and supervise financial institutions in the context of merger applications and in the tailoring of our regulations and supervision.Predictability in Reviewing Bank Mergers Recently, there has been significant attention focused on the role of federal bank regulators in reviewing merger applications, with scrutiny of not only the rigor of the review, but also on how the review process impacts the merger applicants. I certainly welcome this discussion and hearing public feedback, to see if the process can be improved.Congress established the factors that must be considered when the Federal Reserve and other regulators review bank",0.09085337,0.015435806,0.89371085,neutral,0.07541756,neutral,0.8858948945999146

These include the competitive effects of the proposed merger, financial and managerial resources, future prospects of the merged institutions, convenience and needs of the communities to be served, compliance with money laundering laws, and the effect of the transaction on the stability of the financial system. Although the review framework is the same for all applications, the facts of each case can vary widely, from community bank mergers to mergers of much larger institutions that can affect markets across large regions of the country. While this variability necessitates an in-depth review of each transaction on its own merits, these reviews are most effective when the expectations of the regulators are clear in advance and the parties can reasonably anticipate the application review process.The agencies are required to review the statutory factors, but it is",0.030577583,0.025540648,0.9438818,neutral,0.005036935,neutral,0.9434202313423157

There are significant consequences to firms when applications are not acted on in a timely manner, including increased operational risk, the additional expense associated with running two institutions in parallel over a longer period of time, employee retention issues, and perceived reputational risk. Congress has also recognized the need for prompt action, imposing a variety of time limits for agency action on bank applications.3 Recently, we have seen an increase in average processing times in the merger review process.4 I am concerned about delays in the applications process and am concerned that the increase in average processing times will become the new normal.I think it's helpful to consider the source of delays in processing applications and consider whether there are opportunities for improvement.

The legal standards we apply have not changed, and yet the review of applications can be affected by incomplete or inaccurate information or information that does not meet the expectations for an approvable transaction. Filling this information gap with clearer guidance, and making sure applicants understand our expectations could meaningfully improve the process. New supervisory information that comes to light during the examination process can also lead to delays, particularly if new supervisory issues need to be remediated before the application can be approved. In these cases, transparency between the regulator and the applicant helps ensure clear expectations about potential delays.That being said, improved transparency only goes so far.

I think it is helpful to consider whether this process could be improved, so that bona fide concerns raised by the public are appropriately considered, while still ensuring timely decision-making.Finally, to reiterate a point I've made in the past, I continue to believe that the application process should not be used as a substitute for rulemaking.

Tailoring was a core feature of the response to the 2008 financial crisis and since then has been the subject of a concerted effort to refine and improve the regulatory and supervisory framework based on experience since the framework was implemented.5 Tailoring has proven to be an effective and efficient way to regulate and supervise banks of all sizes.Of course, all of you here today are very familiar with risk-based supervision, which is itself a form of tailoring, focusing supervisory attention on areas that pose the greatest risks. But tailoring also helps us adopt meaningful differences in regulatory requirements and supervisory expectations, depending on the size and complexity of the regulated institution, from the largest G-SIBs to the smallest",0.27281564,0.01302293,0.71416146,neutral,0.25979272,positive,0.7053253650665283
2023-02-13,Governor Michelle W. Bowman,2023-02-13 10:18:00-05:00,"community banks. This tailored approach manifests itself across the spectrum from the stringency of capital requirements, the regulatory reporting obligations, and the frequency of examination, among many others.Time has demonstrated the virtues of this tailored approach. The U.S. banking system entered the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic with high levels of capital and liquidity, and banks of all sizes supported the economy during the darkest days of the pandemic and have continued to support the economy ever since. This tailored approach should continue to feature prominently in upcoming proposed revisions to the capital framework. While I expect the Board will propose new capital requirements for the largest institutions, including the Basel III ""endgame"" reforms, I do not expect every tier of firms to be subject to the same changes. And my understanding is that",0.43036073,0.012043849,0.55759543,neutral,0.4183169,positive,0.6607200503349304

Bowman,2023-02-13 10:19:00-05:00,"there are no plans to propose changes to the community bank capital framework as part of this capital review.This tailored approach is sensible not only by matching regulation to risk, but it is embedded in the statutory framework. For example, the bipartisan Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief and Consumer Protection Act included several elements designed to tailor regulatory requirements. For the largest firms, this law instructs the Board to tailor its ""enhanced prudential standards"" frameworkathe strictest standardsato firms based on the risks they pose. This statute also reduced the burden on smaller institutions, including through the community bank leverage ratio, the creation of short-form call reports for smaller community banks and a longer examination cycle for small, well-capitalized banks. In my view, the current community bank capital requirements, including the community bank leverage ratio, are functioning",0.10025071,0.020257032,0.8794923,neutral,0.07999368,neutral,0.9260507225990295
2023-02-13,Governor Michelle W. Bowman,2023-02-13 10:20:00-05:00,"well.In practice, tailoring requires a framework that both distinguishes firms by size, risk, and complexity, and imposes appropriate regulatory requirements in light of these differences. The largest institutions are classified by a number of factors including size, cross-jurisdictional activity, reliance on short-term wholesale funding, off-balance sheet exposures, and nonbank assets. These factors, and the G-SIB scoring methodology more broadly, help contrast the largest firms that pose the greatest risks with the smaller and less systemic firms. This translates into a regulatory regime where the G-SIBs are subject to the most stringent standards, incorporating enhancements like a GSIB-specific risk-based capital surcharge and the enhanced supplementary leverage ratio. Even the smallest banks are subject to size and risk considerations in their supervisory expectations, like a longer examination cycle, and straight forward capital and liquidity requirements and expectations.This",0.06097437,0.01819776,0.9208278,neutral,0.04277661,neutral,0.9047775268554688

As the financial system has evolved over time, so has the regulatory and supervisory framework designed to further the goals of safety and soundness, and financial stability.

It is great to be back at a Global Interdependence Center conference. Given recent events in crypto, it is certainly timely to have a day of discussions related to digital assets.1Before diving into today's talks, which will touch on various parts of the crypto ecosystem, I'd like to clearly define some concepts to ensure we're all talking about the same things. I think of the crypto ecosystem as consisting of three parts:The latter two parts may facilitate the trading of crypto-assets, but also have much broader applications.First, let's consider distributed ledger technology. The technology is simply a database management protocol that has various permissions regarding who can write to the database and who can read the database.

In fact, distributed ledger technology is being explored to potentially address a wide range of data management problems.Next, there are various technologies related to crypto-assets. One is the use of smart contracts in peer-to-peer trading. Smart contracts also can be used in conjunction with a centralized data management protocol to automate the execution of certain transactions in non-crypto-assets. For example, over time, they could be used to speed up the clearance and settlement of securities transactions. Another emerging technology is tokenization. In any trade of assets, there are issues regarding how much personal information you need to provide to conduct the trade. For example, some personal information is needed to protect against the possibility of anonymous trading, which can promote money",0.04170704,0.040122468,0.9181705,neutral,0.0015845709,neutral,0.9323219656944275

Tokenization, when combined with data vaults to securely store personal information, can be used to trade objects in a way that protects one's identity from being exploited for profit. While these technological developments are still in their infancy, they have potential applications beyond the crypto ecosystem that could lead to substantial productivity enhancements in other industries.This leaves us with the crypto-assets themselves. The question is, why would someone hold such an asset? What is the value proposition of such an asset? The answer isn't new or unique, but rather is based on economic relationships that result in objects having value. One reason objects have value is because of their intrinsic properties. For example, the value of corn derives in part from the fact that it can be used for food or fuel, or in some cases for",0.04710558,0.026427848,0.9264665,neutral,0.020677732,neutral,0.9119575619697571

Intuition suggests that if an object has no intrinsic value, then the price of that object should be zeroawhy pay for something that has no fundamental value? Shockingly, it turns out that objects may be valued well above what their intrinsic properties would suggest. Since Paul Samuelson's seminal work in 1958 on intertemporal consumption smoothing, economists have known that an intrinsically useless object can trade at a positive price.2 Such an object's value is driven purely by belief. If I believe someone will pay a positive price for this object in the future, then I may be willing to pay a positive price now, carry it across time, and sell it when I need to consume other goods and services. Samuelson referred to this concept as ""the social contrivance of money.""While an intrinsically useless object can",0.077607684,0.05520294,0.86718935,neutral,0.022404745,neutral,0.8611301183700562

What if one day, beliefs change and I no longer believe that someone will pay me for this object in the future? Then I clearly shouldn't pay anything for it today, so its price goes to zero.There are many intrinsically useless objects that still have value.

It looks as though economic activity may be moderating further in the first quarter of 2023, but I expect the U.S. economy to continue growing at a modest pace this year, supported by a strong labor market and by encouraging progress in lowering inflation.Though we have made progress reducing inflation, I want to be clear",0.8936631,0.06264034,0.043696668,positive,0.83102274,negative,0.6657431721687317

Inflation is still too high relative to the price stability goal of the dual mandate assigned to the Federal Reserve by Congress. The Fed has defined that goal as 2 percent annual inflation, as measured by the change in the price index for personal consumption expenditures, but another yardstick you could use is when high prices for groceries and other things are no longer front page news, and when farmers can worry less about rising costs for fertilizer and other inputs.That is where we intend to get to, and thus the FOMC last week increased the target range for the federal funds rate by another 25 basis points, to 4-1/2 to 4-3/4 percent.

That is why I am determined to get the job done, get high inflation off the front pages, and back to being something that households and businesses don't think too much about when making decisions.Continued upward pressure on inflation comes, in part, from a very tight labor market.

I will talk about what those components can tell us about the direction of overall inflation and how I look at the different parts of inflation in my approach to monetary policy.Figure 1 depicts inflation measured by two common indexes.

Government statistics on the inflation rate will be a function of the specific goods and services included in the market basket. Including a different set of goods and services in the market basket will result in a different overall inflation rate.Probably the most often-discussed inflation measure in the United States is one based on the consumer price index (CPI). The CPI is widely used as a cost-of-living index to adjust Social Security and other payments. The CPI puts considerable weight on the prices of food, energy, and shelter. These three items account for about 50 percent of the expenditures in the CPI basket.2A second measure that is frequently watched is the one I mentioned",0.03241043,0.08344272,0.8841468,neutral,-0.051032286,neutral,0.8545171022415161

As we can see in the figure, though PCE inflation is down from its peak, it is still quite elevated.

The core measure is considered a better guide to the direction of future inflation. You might wonder why it is that the Fed doesn't just target core inflation in measuring progress toward our price stability goal.

One can see the recent volatility in figure 2 that reports 12-month rates of inflation for food and energy. Energy prices were decreasing for most of 2020 (they fell 10 percent during that period) but then switched to very large increases in 2021 and the first half of 2022.

I know that farmers have been dealing with sharply rising input costs, and that is a significant factor driving up wholesale and retail prices for many food products. As shown in figure 3, inflation for agricultural chemicals, such as fertilizer, skyrocketed in 2021 and continued up in early 2022 and, though this inflation has moderated in recent months, the price level of agricultural chemicals remains very high.Core inflation,",0.6339648,0.2997689,0.0662663,positive,0.33419588,positive,0.5095298886299133

Core inflation includes a measure of housing services, which is what households pay for rent or the equivalent for those who own their homes. Housing services inflation has been stubbornly high for all of 2022 and is a big factor driving up core inflation. There is good reason to believe rents will moderate significantly over this year and so some people have suggested that the focus should be on a ""super core"" measure of inflation that excludes food, energy, and housing.

Excluding this large share of consumer spending doesn't give you an accurate picture of what consumers are facing in their everyday lives, and that is a perspective that policymakers should never forget.The third reason to include, rather than exclude, these prices in considering inflation is that they make up an even larger share of expenses for lower-income people, who have less savings and other means to deal with the ups and downs of their finances and the economy. Recent research indicates that the share of overall spending that lower-income households dedicate to food, energy and housing is about 1.2 times (or 20 percent more) than",0.053594023,0.10513748,0.84126854,neutral,-0.05154346,neutral,0.8793764710426331

Because of this disparity, when inflation peaked last summer, lower-income households effectively faced inflation that was a percentage point higher than was paid by higher-income households.3Lastly, and this is really the bottom line, the Fed has stated that its target for inflation is headline PCE prices. So, to meet the Fed's price stability objective, policymakers are accounting for all the categories of goods and services that affect households.With that context, let me take a few minutes on each of the three big categories to highlight how they have been moving, and I think there is some good news. Let's look at each category in the order of how much consumers spend on them each month.

As I just noted, housing inflation has been stubbornly elevated. This is true if you look at inflation over the past year or just at recent months. But high frequency measures of market rents (for new leases by new tenants) have slowed sharply, suggesting an upcoming slowing in the rate of inflation in this part of the PCE basket. Because rents usually don't change until leases run out, these recent declines in market rent inflation will only show through to the official inflation measure with a delay.

More recently, we can see that the 3-month change in the PCE price index for food has slowed considerably, which is a good sign. But food inflation is still above the average annual pace of 1.1 percent over the ten years preceding the pandemic. This ongoing elevated food inflation likely reflects passthrough of the past strong increases in food commodity prices, rising labor and fuel costs, as well as supply-chain bottlenecks in packaging and transportation that have limited supplies amid strong demand.

However, futures prices for these commodities suggest limited movements in these prices through year end. If this plays out, with a slowdown in wage increases that should occur because of tighter monetary policy, this should help continue to moderate food inflation over the next few years.Finally, let's turn to energy inflation. Households spend less than 5 percent of their PCE basket on gasoline, electricity, and heating but, as seen in the left panel of figure 8, the energy price index skyrocketed over the past couple of years, reflecting a surge in crude oil prices after the pandemic recession which was exacerbated by Russia's invasion",0.43248478,0.1260767,0.4414386,neutral,0.30640808,positive,0.4784259796142578

In such an economy, people would have access to credit on fair and equal terms to build a secure financial foundation. Yet, despite widespread acceptance of this vision, we have a way to go in making it a reality, particularly for Black households. I'm going to speak to three drivers of this disparity, and three ways that the financial services community should work together to address them.First, there are significant and troubling disparities in lending outcomes for Black individuals and businesses relative to others.4 While research suggests that progress has been made in addressing racial discrimination in mortgage lending, regulators continue to find evidence of redlining and pricing discrimination in mortgage lending at individual institutions.5 Recent research on auto lending",0.21480298,0.07787435,0.7073227,neutral,0.13692863,neutral,0.7809682488441467

Barr,2023-02-07 10:04:00-05:00,"data indicates that racial bias may lead to higher rates for Blacks on financing to purchase cars.6 A recent study finds that automating decisions reduced disparities in lending to Black-owned businesses in the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP), suggesting the persistence of discrimination in that market.7 And the Federal Reserve System's Small Business Credit Survey has found that over many years, Black-owned businesses reported more significant credit access challenges, including feeling discouraged from applying for credit, being denied credit, and being approved for less than the amount they originally applied for, compared to other business owners.8Compounding these challenges is the racial wealth gap.9 Federal Reserve data from 2019 show that White families had about eight times the wealth of Black families.10 White families had a median wealth of approximately $188,000, compared to $24,000 for Black families.11",0.076998934,0.8527476,0.0702535,negative,-0.77574867,negative,0.8362982869148254

These low levels of wealth also make it difficult for Black families to weather emergencies, such as job loss, or pay for unexpected expenses, which can lead to eviction, repossession of vehicles, and other devastating consequences.And there are racial disparities in financial services. While there has been significant progress over the last twenty-five years in expanding access to banking services, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC)'s most recent annual survey of the unbanked and underbanked found that the unbanked rate for Black households was 11.3 percent, compared to just 2.1 percent for White households.12 The unbanked rate for Black households in Mississippi was",0.05898992,0.7936292,0.14738081,negative,-0.7346393,negative,0.8561133742332458

In addition to higher unbanked rates, only 48.8 percent of Black households nationally had a credit card, compared to 78.1 percent of White households.14 Credit card ownership rates were even lower in Mississippi at 28.4 percent for Black households, compared to 64.5 percent for White households.15 A credit card not only provides a buffer for unexpected expenses, it also allows individuals to accrue a credit historyacentral to accessing credit in the future.Addressing These Issues Now let me turn to some ways to make progress.

It is incumbent on financial institutions to devote resources to stamp out these practices, and on regulators to reinforce the importance of this goal through supervision and enforcement.Second: Look for opportunities to support a vibrant and thriving economy for the benefit of everyone. This means seeking out opportunities to invest in low- and moderate-income (LMI) communities, small businesses, and community infrastructure.Third: Develop products and services that can help people save and build wealth.Eradicating Discrimination I'll start with our collective responsibility for eradicating discrimination in underwriting, lending, and other aspects of financial services.

Discrimination in housing and lending became illegal in 1968 and 1974, respectively, through passage of the Fair Housing Act, and the Equal Credit Opportunity Act. Congress passed laws, such as the Community Reinvestment Act in 1977, to remediate redlining. But history casts a long shadow.How can weaboth banks and regulatorsaunderstand and address these problems where they persist? To start, there are some areas where we need better data. For example, small business lending data required by section 1071 of the Dodd-Frank Act, once implemented, will provide tangible",0.10358234,0.089226045,0.8071916,neutral,0.014356293,neutral,0.7679612636566162

Banks should also actively analyze their own data to identify areas where racial disparities occur. On-the-ground testing, using techniques such as mystery shopping, may also help to identify discriminatory practices.18 And to the extent that a bank uses AI or other algorithmic systems in making lending decisions, they should review the underlying models, such as their credit scoring and underwriting systems, as well as their marketing and loan servicing activities, just as they should for more traditional models.19Racial bias in the residential real estate market has long been noted as a source of concern.20 In January, the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council's Appraisal Subcommittee held a public hearing on appraisal bias in the residential real estate market.

It is simply good business. Ensuring that all would-be borrowers are treated equally means more customers, more loans, and better returns for banks.The Federal Reserve and our fellow regulators have a clear responsibility to use our supervisory and enforcement tools.21 All firms have a responsibility to operate in a manner consistent with safety and soundness and in compliance with laws and regulations, including those related to consumer protection.

Such collaboration is critical to ensure a level playing field and strong consumer protection enforcement.Supporting Vibrant Communities But even if we address current discriminatory practices, we are still left with the legacy of discrimination and redlining, which helped perpetuate economically depressed Black neighborhoods.22 Historically, these neighborhoods have not had the benefit of robust credit and financial services, which hindered their growth and left them less economically connected than wealthier neighborhoods.

Compared to other banks, MDIs originate a greater share of mortgages to minority borrowers and borrowers who live in lower- and middle-income census tracts.24 And they played a critical role in disbursing the PPP.

Through their lending to local communities and small businesses, they often know their customers personally and engage in community-building activities.Large banks also have a key part to play. For example, in 2022, many large financial institutions initiated or expanded special purpose credit programs, many of which provide mortgage assistance to benefit Black and Hispanic communities.26 In addition to their own lending, they help support MDIs and CDFIs through technical assistance and investment. They often share expertise in technology, business support solutions, tax considerations, and bringing programs to scale.And, as is often true, the impact can be greatest through collective efforts.

The Fund extended credit to small businesses in Detroit that otherwise might not qualify for bank lending, at the rate of more than $2 million a year.27 And that same approach is now being used by eight additional cities and involves more than twenty local CDFI partners. Closer to home, Hopeatogether with a large bank and a set of HBCUsahas partnered to form the Deep South Economic Mobility Collaborative.

The CRA helps to address redlining and other systemic inequities in access to credit, investment, and banking services faced by LMI communities.

In 2022, the Federal Reserve Board, the FDIC, and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency requested comments from the public on a proposal to do just that. Importantly, the proposal would encourage banks to expand access in LMI communities to home mortgage, small business, and other credit, to make community development investments, and engage in lending and banking services. The proposal would adapt the regulations to address changes in the banking sector, including internet and mobile banking, and update the approach to assessment areas.

As I've said before, mergers are a feature of vibrant industries, but the advantages that firms seek to gain through mergers must be weighed against the risks posed, and the costs and benefits to the community. There is likely important work we can do to improve our assessment of the convenience and needs factor for bank mergers.We also have an important role to play in ensuring that our safety and soundness regulations do not needlessly impede financial inclusion.

And as ECIP funds are made available, regulators have an important role to play in ensuring our examiners are informed and knowledgeable about the work being conducted under these new programs.Responsive Products Last, let me turn to the need to develop products that are responsive to customer needs. As many have said, it's expensive to be poor. And many poor people lack any financial slack, such as savings, to tide them over through an emergency.

There is an opportunity for traditional banks and mission-driven organizations to fill this gap, but to be effective, they need to understand consumer preferences and behavior to provide products and services that meet these needs in a safer and fairer way.Starting with customer preference, we know that speed can be key. Income disruption and unexpected expenses are more common in LMI households, and quick access to a loan can make all the difference. With proper safeguards, unsecured small dollar credit to consumers with less-than-prime credit scores can be very important in helping people meet this need.31 We have seen banks begin offering small dollar loans to some existing customers by factoring account data",0.26678762,0.014728463,0.718484,neutral,0.25205916,neutral,0.8359472751617432

These products are typically available through the bank's online interface, which streamlines the process and speeds up decisions. Although some of these may be considered high-cost products, they are still less costly than payday loans or the cost of what many banks charge for overdraft protection.As an operator and regulator of payment systems, the Federal Reserve also has a role in faster payments. We're working to launch FedNow, which, once widely adopted, will better enable banks to offer customers the ability to send and receive money immediately at low cost.

Strongly recommended features include low minimum balances, no overdraft fees, robust transaction options, and online bill pay.32 More than 46,000 banks and credit union branches across the country currently offer Bank On certified accounts, and more than 5.8 million Bank On-certified accounts were open and active in 2021.33In addition to considering customer preference, product design should help to counter, not lean into, biases that can lead to poor financial decision-making.34 Being aware of these can help banks help customers better understand risks",0.5034103,0.010971376,0.48561835,positive,0.4924389,positive,0.8128951191902161

Some banks have eliminated overdraft fees entirely.Regulators need to understand both human decision-making and market context in designing the right rules of the road. Regulators also need to engage with techniques, such as cash flow underwriting and alternative data, new credit models, and other technologies that hold out the promise to increase access and reduce bias in credit intermediation.36Diversity in the workforce of financial institutions also matters for",0.11258347,0.019849634,0.8675668,neutral,0.09273384,neutral,0.8660600185394287

It has been close to a year since the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) began tightening monetary policy. We began raising interest rates in March 2022 and shrinking our securities holdings in June in order to bring inflation down to our 2 percent target.1 Today I thought I would spend a few minutes taking stock of the year behind us and talking about what's next.A year ago, inflation was elevated and rapidly accelerating, and the Fed moved to quickly and dramatically tighten monetary policy. At the end of December, the federal funds rate target was set in a range of 4.25 percent to 4.5 percent, the highest in 15 years.

After shrinking slightly in the first half of 2022, real gross domestic product grew at an annual rate of 3.2 percent in the third quarter, and monthly data suggest it grew around 2 percent in the fourth quarter. I expect such slowing to continue in this quarter, which is both expected and desirable in our ongoing fight to lower inflation.The FOMC's goal in raising interest rates is to dampen demand and economic activity to support further reductions in inflation. And there is ample evidence that this is exactly what is going on in the business sector. On the manufacturing side, industrial production declined for the second month in December. And the Institute for Supply Management's (ISM) forward-looking indicators of orders and customers' inventory suggested that further weakening is in train. Meanwhile, the ISM survey",0.022392033,0.9495871,0.028020894,negative,-0.9271951,positive,0.9106922745704651

This slowdown in services activity was widespread, affecting 11 of 17 sectors in the survey, with significant slowdowns in construction and real estate, two industries heavily affected by higher interest rates. This slowing in business activity is consistent with the FOMC's goal of damping demand and reducing production so that it is in better alignment with the productive capacity of the economy. The goal is not, I would emphasize, to halt economic activity, and so we will be watching these sectors closely to see how this moderation continues.Growth in consumer spending has also begun to slow. While that growth was surprisingly strong through most of the second half of 2022, nominal personal consumption expenditures growth slowed to 0.1 percent",0.014951232,0.962329,0.022719726,negative,-0.94737774,negative,0.9684686064720154

While the latest readings of consumer sentiment from the University of Michigan moved up some from historic lows, I continue to expect that last year's decline in real incomes, along with higher borrowing costs, will moderate consumer spending this year and help return inflation more promptly to the FOMC's 2 percent target. Job one is maintaining the progress we are making in lowering inflation, and moderation in consumer spending will support that progress.The slowing in output growth has occurred alongside the continuing strength of the labor market.

The unemployment rate was 3.5 percent in December, matching the low reached before the pandemic, and the lowest in 53 years. But there are signs that demand for labor is moderating.

It shows that jobs and income can hold up to the effects of higher interest rates, helping the FOMC continue its efforts to lower inflation to our 2 percent goal by further tightening monetary policy.A potential downside of a tight labor market is if labor costs, which heavily influence inflation, grow so fast that they slow progress toward the FOMC's 2 percent objective.

The 3-month annualized change in average hourly earningsa4.1 percent in Decemberais running below the 12-month rate and is thus a signal of ongoing moderation. These are encouraging signs, but we need to see continued improvement across various measures of labor costs, because additional moderation is needed to bring inflation down to our 2 percent goal and because a significant escalation in wage growth could drive up longer-range inflation expectations.

2023-01-20,Governor Christopher J. Waller,2023-01-20 10:08:00-05:00,"inflation in December was a significant drop in energy prices, which more than offset an increase in food prices. The FOMC targets headline inflation because food and energy are considerable expenses for most people, but they are more volatile than other components of the index, and by factoring them out, ""core"" inflation can provide a picture of where inflation is headed. Here also, we are seeing some progress. Yearly core inflation was down in December to 5.7 percent, from 6 percent in November and a peak of 6.6 percent in September. Over the past three months, core CPI inflation has run at an annualized rate of 3.1 percent, a noticeable drop from earlier in 2022.Another encouraging sign is that higher inflation was less concentratedathe share of categories of different goods and services with inflation over 3 percent",0.014266072,0.9657655,0.019968377,negative,-0.9514994,negative,0.9653750061988831

That's good news because it indicates that broader inflationary pressure across the economy is easing.Now, here's why I am cautious about these latest results and why I am not ready yet to substantially alter my outlook for inflation. Month-over-month core CPI inflation actually ticked up in December from November and is pretty much where it was in October and where it was in March when we began raising interest rates. Although inflation measured over 12 months has been falling, December's reading is still close to where it was a year ago.

The shorter the trend, the larger the grain of salt when swallowing a story about the future. Back in 2021, we saw three consecutive months of relatively low readings of core inflation before it jumped back up. We do not want to be head-faked. I will be looking for the recent improvement in headline and core inflation to continue.Wages, as I indicated earlier, are another stream of data that I will be watching for evidence of continued progress to help ease overall inflation. Though recent hourly earnings data are a positive development, I need to see more evidence of wage moderation to sustainable levels.

We have made progress. Six months ago, when inflation was escalating and economic output had flattened, I argued that a soft landing was still possibleathat it was quite plausible to make progress on inflation without seriously damaging the labor market.

When the FOMC began raising the federal funds rate last spring from near zero, it made sense to move quickly. But after front-loading monetary policy tightening, with many unprecedented 75 basis point hikes in the federal funds rate target, by early December I believed the policy stance was slightly restrictive, and I supported a decision by the Committee to hike by a still considerable 50 basis points.2 To return to the airplane image, after climbing steeply and using monetary policy to significantly raise interest rates throughout the economy, it was apparent to me that it was time to slow, but not halt, the rate of ascent.And in keeping with this logic and based",0.24825802,0.06864779,0.6830942,neutral,0.17961024,neutral,0.5169445276260376

Inflation is high, and it will take time and resolve to get it back down to 2 percent. We are determined to stay the course.1Financial conditions have tightened considerably over the last year as the Federal Reserve and foreign central banks have tightened policy. Real yields have risen significantly across the curve over the past year: 2-year yields on Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS) have risen more than 4-1/2 percentage points to 2.1 percent, and 10-year TIPS yields have risen more than 2-1/4 percentage points to 1.2 percent.

Looking forward, weaker readings on real income, wealth, and sentiment, along with indicators of spending on services, such as the ISM services index, point to subdued growth in 2023.4 Real disposable personal income declined, on net, at an annual rate of 4.1 percent in the first three quarters of 2022, suggesting that recent consumption has been supported by running down pandemic savings and greater reliance on credit.5 In particular, savings among low-income households appear to be lower and to have declined more rapidly than was previously appreciated.6The widespread expectation for U.S. growth to be below potential over 2022 and 2023 reflects significant tightening in both fiscal and monetary policy in an environment of broader global tightening.

From March to December 2022, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) undertook a large cumulative tightening in the stance of monetary policy by raising the policy rate 4-1/4 percentage points and shrinking the balance sheet.

That said, there is uncertainty about the timing and magnitude.With that in mind, let's turn to the implications for the employment leg of our dual mandate. In contrast to the slowing of output growth, labor markets remained tight throughout 2022, with layoffs remaining below pre-pandemic levels and the unemployment rate ending the year at 3.5 percent, its historical low.

Similarly, average weekly hours have declined: After peaking in early 2021 and remaining elevated through May 2022, average weekly hours have declined and now stand at the bottom of the range for this metric over the five years before the pandemic. The continued decline in average weekly hours is notable because this margin is among the easiest to adjust by firms facing declining demand, especially those who may be reluctant to undertake layoffs following the challenges encountered in restoring employment following the pandemic-induced layoffs.

However, in the aggregate, the gains among lower-wage workers were more than offset by real wage declines among middle- and higher-wage workers in the context of a broader compression in the real wage distribution, as David Autor points out.10 Overall, the labor share of income has declined over the past two years and appears to be at or below pre-pandemic levels, while corporate profits as a share of GDP remain near postwar highs.Retail markups in a number of sectors have seen material increases in what could be described as a priceaprice spiral, whereby final prices have risen by more than the increases",0.012486455,0.9697369,0.017776623,negative,-0.9572504,negative,0.9667012095451355

There are a range of views on what it will take to bring down this component of inflation to pre-pandemic levels. Since wages constitute a significant fraction of costs for most firms in nonhousing services, one possible channel is through a weakening in labor demand. That said, to the extent that inputs other than wages may have been responsible in part for important price increases for some nonhousing service sectors, an unwinding of these factors could help bring down nonhousing services inflation.There is some recent evidence that the persistent components of inflation in core goods and nonhousing services, particularly transportation, recreation, and food services and accommodation,",0.07316553,0.66217315,0.26466137,negative,-0.5890076,negative,0.8789777755737305

For these reasons, it remains possible that a continued moderation in aggregate demand could facilitate continued easing in the labor market and reduction in inflation without a significant loss of employment.18Nonetheless, substantial uncertainty remains.

In parallel, balance sheet runoff is continuing.

I take this as a hopeful sign that we can succeed in lowering inflation without a significant economic downturn. It is likely that as a part of this process, labor markets will soften somewhat before we bring inflation back to our 2 percent goal. While the effects of monetary policy tightening on the job market have generally been limited so far, slowing the economy will likely mean that job creation also slows. And if there are unforeseen shocks to the economy, growth may slow further.

These dynamics make the difficult decisions facing the FOMC even more challenging, but it is absolutely necessary that the Committee achieves our goal of price stability.From the late 1960s through the mid-1980s, the U.S. economy experienced high inflation, high unemployment, and declining living standards. During that time, policymakers prematurely eased monetary policy when the economy weakened, and inflation remained high. The FOMC was forced to return to tightening monetary policy, causing a deep recession in 1981 and 1982. This is an important lesson that guides my thinking about monetary policy and my continued support for policy actions that will continue to lower inflation.It is also important to remember that today's inflation is a global concern.

Monetary policy can do very little to improve supply disruptions, but it can help bring supply and demand into better alignment.While the path ahead looks uncertain, I am encouraged by three specific developments. The first is the ongoing strength of the labor market, which was further supported with last Friday's jobs report.

The Fed and other banking agencies will continue to focus in this area, in light of the significant risks these activities may pose. But the bottom line is that we do not want to hinder innovation. As regulators, we should support innovation and recognize that the banking industry must evolve to meet consumer demand. By inhibiting innovation, we could be pushing growth in this space into the non-bank sector, leading to much less transparency and potential financial stability risk.

Several foreign governments and central banks are exploring digital currency, and there are many competing proposals suggesting a need to create a digital currency. The common theme underlying the need in these proposals is the desire to increase the speed and reduce the cost of financial transactions. Last January, the Fed published a paper soliciting comment on possible forms and uses of a CBDC in the United States. The Fed continues to study the idea, although much of what supporters hope to achieve with a central bank digital currency may be provided through FedNow and existing private payment services.

First, the Federal Reserve's monetary policy independence is an important and broadly supported institutional arrangement that has served the American public well. Second, the Fed must continuously earn that independence by using our tools to achieve our assigned goals of maximum employment and price stability, and by providing transparency to facilitate understanding and effective oversight by the public and their elected representatives in Congress. Third, we should ""stick to our knitting"" and not wander off to pursue perceived social benefits that are not tightly linked to our statutory goals and authorities.Central bank independence and transparency On the first point, the case for monetary policy independence lies in the benefits of insulating monetary policy decisions from short-term political considerations.1 Price stability is the bedrock of a healthy economy and provides the public with immeasurable benefits over time.

The absence of direct political control over our decisions allows us to take these necessary measures without considering short-term political factors. I believe that the benefits of independent monetary policy in the U.S. context are well understood and broadly accepted.2In a well-functioning democracy, important public policy decisions should be made, in almost all cases, by the elected branches of government. Grants of independence to agencies should be exceedingly rare, explicit, tightly circumscribed, and limited to those issues that clearly warrant protection from short-term political considerations.With independence comes the responsibility to provide the transparency that enables effective oversight by Congress, which, in turn, supports the Fed's democratic legitimacy.

Independence in this area helps ensure that the public can be confident that our supervisory decisions are not influenced by political considerations.5 Today, some analysts ask whether incorporating into bank supervision the perceived risks associated with climate",0.19481806,0.034368217,0.7708137,neutral,0.16044985,neutral,0.542803943157196

Decisions about policies to directly address climate change should be made by the elected branches of government and thus reflect the public's will as expressed through elections.At the same time, in my view, the Fed does have narrow, but important, responsibilities regarding climate-related financial risks. These responsibilities are tightly linked to our responsibilities for bank supervision.6 The public reasonably expects supervisors to require that banks understand, and appropriately manage, their material risks, including the financial risks of climate change.But without explicit congressional legislation, it would be inappropriate for us to use our monetary policy or supervisory tools to promote a greener economy or to achieve other climate-based goals.7 We are not, and will not be, a ""climate policymaker.""",0.050000872,0.04181616,0.908183,neutral,0.008184712,neutral,0.9201855063438416

The unique nature of the supply and demand imbalances over the past couple of years has made it more difficult to forecast inflation, posing new challenges for monetary policy. One way to better manage these challenges is by continuing to monitoraand even expandanew sources of data. Additionally, we have some key issues to consider in approaching revised models of inflation behavior.Before I turn to broader issues with modeling inflation, let me start with the recent inflation data. Inflation remains far too high, despite some encouraging signs lately, and is therefore of great concern.

Core PCE prices rose 4.7 percent over the same 12-month period (figure 1). This measure omits volatile food and energy prices and tends to give a more accurate signal of total inflation's trajectory. Both figures are down a bit from the peaks reached in the first half of last year. However, monthly data are quite volatile, so I would caution against putting too much weight on the past few favorable monthly data reports.The high and volatile inflation seen over the past two years appears to reflect rapid shifts in demand, coupled with supply-chain disruptions. This has led to sizable demandasupply imbalances across different sectors.

In contrast to core goods inflation, which has declined over the past year, housing services inflation has continued to rise rapidly, and inflation in other core services has been little changed on balance. In the current environment, I find it helpful to examine a number of somewhat new indicators when assessing inflation pressures within each category.Starting with goods inflation, I have been closely observing indicators of capacity constraints along global and domestic supply chains.

Available measures of market rents suggest that the price increases for new tenant leases have slowed substantially over the past year. Some monthly measures have barely increased or even declined recently. This pattern may in part reflect the easing of some special factors that shifted demand during the peak of the pandemic, such as the surge in work from home and the associated increase in demand for bigger homes located in smaller metro areas or further from city centers.

The inflation outlook for this non-housing category of core services partly depends on whether growth in nominal labor costs comes back down, and recent data suggest that labor-compensation growth has indeed started to decelerate somewhat over the past year. In addition to keeping close tabs on measures of labor costs, I have found it valuable to use some high-frequency indicators of services spending, particularly in the leisure & hospitality and travel sectors (figure 7).

We should keep a close eye on the incoming indicators of production disruptions and bottlenecks. We should also advance our understanding of how an environment of more frequent disruptions to the production and distribution systems will affect potential output, feed into inflation, and become an important element in forecasting inflation, assessing risks, and adjusting monetary policy.We must also continue to advance our understanding of inflation and its underlying structural causal relationships as well as our ability",0.23867707,0.026285166,0.73503774,neutral,0.2123919,neutral,0.6761664152145386

For example, inflation could become a nonstationary time-series process if inflation expectations were to become de-anchored.The responses to these questions lie in further researcharesearch that will be made richer, more useful, and, hopefully, easier if we expand our data sources to include more real-time and other novel indicators.
